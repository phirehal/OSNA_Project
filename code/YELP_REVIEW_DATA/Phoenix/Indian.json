Owners work hard to keep customers happy."], ["Charada G.", "I had the lunch buffet. Best sambar I've ever had anywhere, including India. The serve yourself masala tea is perfect. No sugar so you can sweeten to your own taste, and perfectly spiced with masala. I love that they don't sugar it because I have my own birch sugar, which has the consistency and taste of sugar but is not run through animal bone ash like regular sugar, so I can adhere to my vegetarian ethics.The potato masala, which I smothered with the dal Tarka, was so good I had to test each individually to see which tasted better. \u00a0A dead tie--equally delicious.The coconut chutney was subtle, & mixed with a little curd rice, I found it the perfect complement to the dosa. I went back to the buffet for a few extra mushroom 65 for an excuse to get some more chutney! I tried the curd rice & the chutney individually also, and while they were both excellent, it wasn't until their flavors mingled that an ecstatic explosion happened across my taste buds.Living in Houston, with its plethora of excellent Indian vegetarian restaurants serving our large south Asian population, I am more than a little spoiled by the variety and have come to appreciate and recognize excellence when I taste it. If this restaurant were in Houston, the owners would become wealthy very quickly, while setting a new standard in a town already known and appreciated for its fantastic variety and quality of Indian fare."], ["Nai W.", "Fix your damn website.

Friendly staff and decent place to visit."], ["Dan K.", "Apparently this restaurant has been open for years, and I just now became aware of it.Boy, am I sure glad I am!The food sure is a delight to feast upon!I love that it's all vegetarian. And it's fun for me that it's South Indian, because I'm more familiar with North Indian. Favorites on the buffet today for me are the masala paneer, tomato rice dish, lentil daal, raita, the dosas served at each table, the paper-thin \"crunchy circles\" whose name escapes me (though I'm not sure it was really ever \"captured\" by me!), the mango fruit salad, eggplant dish - and chai, on the buffet just the way I love it!I read some reviews commenting on the bottles of water at each table. To me it may not seem as classy as a nice pitcher of water, with ice. Although, in Phoenix, knowing the water tastes just fine is a bonus.The service was attentive, to me. Although I've seen comments from others suggesting that was not the same for them. Patrons may sit wherever they want. I just happened to sit in the half of the restaurant well-traveled by staff. I was between a curtain-covered door, and the kitchen door. That might be the secret to friendly attention; although I did not notice the level of service people on the other side of the middle divider received.I received warm and friendly service. In fact, I was pleased when the hostess/server offered me a second dosa. She seemed appreciative when I complimented her/them on how great everything is.This is very exciting for me, because I feel I've discovered another excellent Indian buffet near the places I usually frequent. That makes three near North Scottsdale, and one on the West Side.So I'm loving it!The only thing that wasn't great was the atmosphere itself. The floor I walked on was sticky. I noticed on the other side of the half I was dining at, the tables had a glass pane over the table cloth. My table at least did not. It was kind of dingy; not elegant, certainly.That's not a drawback for me. I choose a place based on the food, first, and secondly on the service. Anything else is \"gravy\". So no worries for me.This place is now near the top of my \"Best Indian Buffet\" list!"], ["Nishi S.", "I drove all for 45 mins to come check this place out, and it was closed. \u00a0There was a sign that said closed on Mondays. And yelp shows their business hours as open. Very disappointed."], ["Tigra C.", "I love Indian cuisine, and being still fairly new to the valley, I'm trying to find the best places in town for Indian food. \u00a0I bought a Groupon for Madras Ananda Bhavan a few months ago and decided to go for dinner last night.As we approached I saw a sign on their front door warning/ advising customers that if they use a Groupon gratuity will be automatically added to their bill. \u00a0I found that to be an odd and ostracizing thing to do, but at least they were upfront about it.We arrived before 6pm and it was pretty quiet, with only a few tables present. Nice. I enjoy quiet dining. \u00a0The sign said to wait to be seated. We only had to wait a few seconds before we were seated and the menus were brought. I informed them right away that I'd be using a Groupon. \u00a0I advised the waiter that I was vegan and inquired about the menu items in which I was interested. He was knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly (awesome smiles!).We ordered vegetable samosas ($3.50). They were huge and very good. Crunchy & golden on the outside; savory and spicy on the inside. Their tamarind sauce is stronger and more tart than to what I am accustomed, but it was ok. \u00a0I prefer the sweeter based tamarind sauces though. I ordered the Gobi Manchurian ($8.99). It was absolutely AMAZING! The cauliflower was so perfectly crisp and that red sauce (not spicy) is so flavorful. Outstanding vegan dish!I ordered plain puri/poori ($2.99 for 2 pieces), which is a light vegan bread. \u00a0Plain puri/poori is not on the menu (the menu offers stuffed puris), but just ask for it. It was very good. My dinner mate ordered naan ($2), and the server advised me not to eat it because it contains dairy. \u00a0(Good looking out!) She thought her naan was a little too burnt for her liking. Here's where things go badly...My non-vegan dinner mate wanted Aloo Saag, which is not on the menu. \u00a0The waiter advised that she could order Saag Paneer ($10.99) and add aloo (potatoes), so that's what she did. \u00a0(Note to vegan's who are not familiar with Indian cuisine: saag = spinach, & paneer = cheese, so this is not a vegan dish. \u00a0If you'd like a spinach dish, inquire about them making a vegan version, like Aloo Saag with no dairy.) She really enjoyed her dish until.... she noticed a long piece of hair in her spoonful of saag. \u00a0Process of elimination: she has very long, naturally curly/wavy hair, so it was definitely not her own hair. \u00a0I was sitting across the table and never came near her food, but for s&g let's just add that I have extremely curly hair, so it most certainly was not my hair. I examined it closely to ensure that it wasn't an herb of some sort, but it was indeed a hair follicle. \u00a0Despite my OCD-ness screaming on the inside, I was very calm and maintained a smile as I called over the owner and pointed out the snafu. He apologized profusely, promptly took away the tainted food, and brought her a new dish with new naan.Our dishes were served with a small helping of rice. What is up with the instant white rice?? You get @ 2 spoonfuls of this plain and dry rice. Where is the moist, fluffy, herb-infused, flavor-bursting basmati rice? \u00a0Very disappointing!Pitchers of water were sitting on each table, even the unoccupied ones. Having a pitcher of water at your table is definitely a plus for me because I drink a lot of water. \u00a0However, with that pesky nat (it drove me crazy!) and any other germs flying around, I did not like that the water had just been sitting there for who knows how long (long enough that the ice had melted). And it's a waste of water when you get an OCD customer like myself, who will ask you to bring a fresh pitcher of water with ice in it. \u00a0Just bring out the pitcher once the customer arrives. The bill came and there were 0 concessions for the hair situation. Yes, you brought out a new dish. That's expected. No, I did not appear to be angry, but I was livid and disgusted. There was HAIR in my baby's food! Department of Health &/or Public Safety, hello?! I just chose to behave in a civil and professional manner. \u00a0Wrong is wrong, and one should not have to rant and rave or throw a hissy fit to be accommodated in such circumstances. \u00a0I did not ask, but as a customer service gesture, that dish should've been removed from my bill. \u00a0Despite the excellent Gobi Manchurian and puri/ poori, or the friendly smiles, that was a deal-breaker, so sadly, I have no plans to return."], ["\u00cdzandro M.", "This place is amazing! It has become my new favorite Indian restaurant and I love the fact that it is vegetarian. Not my favorite palak, but the paneer butter masala (add potatoes) and the gobi manchurian are PHENOMENAL! Just had the gobi manchurian for the first time this evening and I think I'm in love. It is now my favorite dish! The only thing two things I have noticed about this place is that the rice they provide is not very flavorful or fragrant. Very plain.

There was an Indian couple sitting at the table next to us, and even though I have had Indian food in London, where it is the national dish, we watched what they were eating and at least for one dish, we said \"we'll have what that is.\" Good thing because as we were leaving, we found out that the place is their \"family restaurant.\" I would venture to guess that translates as they owned the place.Like spicy? The lamb vindaloo was three alarm in my mouth and very good. Glad we had a couple of orders of naan to cool off. Don't drink water with a mouth fire, tap it down with naan! I also had spoonfuls of some other great dishes and tried to get close to the names on my photos. Next time, I am definitely taking a photo of the menu.I also had a few bites of two of the desserts, the mango kulfi and the kala jamun, which also cooled down my mouth and were excellent."], ["John G.", "Wow! \u00a0This place \u00a0(was Bombay Spice) has pivoted twice (and moved once) from an Indian Fusion concept to an Indian Chipotle concept to just a darned good Indian restaurant.That's the history, but all that matters is the present. \u00a0Really great food. \u00a0Good service. \u00a0Real Tandoor oven. \u00a0Start with samosas, then get the lamb vindaloo and an order of naan. \u00a0You'll be a happy camper (and you'll have enough to take home for lunch tomorrow - but get another order of naan to take home!)There's a really good 'sampler' on the lunch menu, give that a go sometime, too!"], ["Jim K.", "I have to tell you from the moment I walked in the smell was just amazing and I could not wait to taste the food.

You don't expect to the get authentic, quality Indian food in Phoenix but this place pulls it off.First of all the service was impeccable. Our server gave us excellent and honest suggestions on which items to order and how to structure our dinner (some street food options to start then sauced and tandoori entrees to follow). He was knowledgable about the menu and extremely attentive. All of our questions were answered and our water glasses remained filled. I recently traveled to South India and I haven't seen Dosa done so true to the authentic way. The coconut chutney was exactly like I had it in India and the Dosa itself was perfectly cooked. I rarely have good shrimp so I was skeptical of the Tandoor shrimp but I was totally wrong. It was tender and teeming with flavor. This is the \"must-get\" item on the menu (another server admitted he eats it every night) We also ordered the Punjabi Bharta (a great vegetarian option) and the eggplant had a perfect smoky flavor to it. The Goan Vindaloo was spicy and very tasty.This place is awesome and we will certainly be back to explore the rest of the menu."], ["Life Z.", "Went for dinner and ordered idli & samosa- they served 2 small sized frozen idli & samosa not even completed heated!!

Our server - David was excellent, \u00a0he recommended and told us what were the popular dishes since this was our first time having Indian Food. We started with the Masala Dosa, a potato and onion crepe which looked like a huge burrito which came with 2 different sauces which was exceptional. Also got the Gol \u00a0Guppa which was a whole wheat puff that you break a hole to stuff which was fun and tasty. We ordered the following entrees - Lamb Chops, Tandoori Salmon and Classic Curry Chicken which all were excellent.

I'm giving this 5 stars and here's why....Exceptional Service, Great Tasting Food, and Nice Atmosphere. \u00a0Just to show you how exceptional our service was, I've numbered every time someone attended to us during our time there.My husband and I went here for our 15th wedding anniversary. \u00a0We always go to an Indian restaurant for our anniversary. \u00a0We usually have Indian food at an all-vegetarian Indian restaurant in Phoenix, but the food quality has become very inconsistent over the past year. So we searched online for a new restaurant and found Marigold Maison. \u00a0We were greeted immediately by (1) Mirnes Mehic, Director of Marketing, as soon as we walked in the door. \u00a0I know his name because he stopped by our table and chatted with us after our meal, talking about the restaurant, the chef, the food. He gave us his card. \u00a0We were in a corner table which was very cozy even though just about every table was filled. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor is lovely. \u00a0Shortly after we were seated another (2) gentleman came over to let us know that our waitress would be with us soon but he could get our drinks. \u00a0Our (3) waitress soon arrived, was very friendly and took our order. \u00a0Before we really noticed that our food seemed to be taking a little longer than would be expected, our waitress came to tell us it would be out soon and placed a basket of complimentary papadums on the table.We are vegetarians so we had: Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer, Masala Dosa, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi. \u00a0 The food was excellent!! \u00a0Saag Paneer was some of the best we've had. \u00a0Masala Dosa was LOADED with potato, Dal Makhani was very flavorful, and the Garlic Naan was fantastic. \u00a0We had the leftover Dal and Saag the next day and it was even tastier. \u00a0 A little warning, the hot sauce that's on the tables is not for the faint of heart. HOT, HOT but very flavorful and you can buy a bottle to take home.During our meal a (4) gentleman came over the refill our drinks and take away any used dishes. \u00a0Another (5) lady came over later to remove any more dishes we were finished with. \u00a0Our waitress stopped by often to check on us. \u00a0Mirnes Mehic stopped by the table and spoke with us. \u00a0He stopped by again later to present us with a complementary Mango Kulfi for our anniversary! \u00a0As if we hadn't already received enough excellent service, (6) The Chef stopped by our table! \u00a0He talked about the ingredients he puts in the foods like olive oil, as well as those he leaves out like ghee, heavy cream, and cashew giving the food a less 'heavy' feeling on the body.Great Experience and Great Food to be had at Marigold Maison!"], ["Monica A.", "I would love for this place to be a go-to Indian place for me, but unfortunately I have to pass. I really, really love the idea and I love its intimate size, but it just seems to be a little too impressed with itself.Firstly, the prices are too high. I know you're doing \"something new and funsion-y\" with Indian food, but please. $20 for a dish just because it has fish? It certainly doesn't warrant that, nor do the other dishes whose prices increase as you add meat selections like chicken, etc.The last time I was here my husband and I ordered an eggplant dish and the chicken tikka masala.I must say the chicken tikka sauce's flavor was OUTSTANDING. Definitely the best I've tasted - very robust and wonderful. The eggplant however, was terribly overpowered by chipotle. Yuck. I've not had those two paired together and I think there's a reason for that. Eggplant is so delicate and its flavor is best supported by the herbs and spices in the dish so its butteriness can be savored - not drowned out by an overly bold spice. Not a well constructed dish at all.Also, both dishes were supposed to be mildly spiced. Our server asked for the spice level, we told her mild (husband doesn't do well with too much spice), and the food came out *at least* medium spiced or hotter. The eggplant was so spicy we had to send it back. My guess is that the chipotle had a lot to do with that, as its inherent heat certainly added to the additional spice used to give the spice gradient to the dishes. Again - chipotle - BAD IDEA.The service that night also was not up to par and certainly didn't support the $46 bill we had at the end. The server *meandered* over to our table after we'd been sitting there for a little too long and kind of looked at us askance WAITING for us to tell her what we wanted. Like she couldn't be bothered too much to let more than just a few words out of her mouth. It was very strange. And the restaurant was NOT busy; no one was in the weeds.All in all, I'm not really impressed enough to make this a regular place. For the prices I expect excellent professional service, well-crafted dishes, and chefs that understand mild, medium, and hot as it relates to Indian food."], ["Hydro W.", "I can't believe I haven't left a review yet.

Usually Indian food doesn't sit well with my stomach but this food I can all the time. We eat marigolds on average at least once or twice a week for lunch.

The mint chutney was delicious, and who am I to complain about complimentary papadum?The chef also went out of his way to make an off-the-menu-dish when I described a particular roti I have eaten elsewhere in the past. This was spectacular - even better than the naan I'd say and perfect for eating with the saag spinach. Our waitress, Gena, was very friendly and helpful to select our dishes.

We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of saut\u00e9ed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was \"we are really busy and need you to leave right now.\" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive."], ["Mrs B.", "Great restaurant! I got a thali for lunch with chicken tikka masala and saag paneer, my favorite! The chicken tikka was delicious and the naan was really, really good. I ordered a mango lassi to drink and it was really good, not too watery not too thick...just perfect.Service was great. We were waited on by a young man named Nick. He was awesome! Really great personality, with good knowledge of menu. The chef came out to see if everything was good, and we were happy to share our delight. Awesome find for a very reasonable price. Our check was like $25 for wine and thalis. We will be back, and we will request Nick again!"], ["Barbara B.", "This place has the best Indian food in Arizona! I've been trying so many different locations and finally found my favorite!

We were starving and excited to see all the options available.Starting off with wine, we sat down and tried not order the whole menu. Our waiter, Nick, suggested the Gol Guppa so we ordered that along with some Samosa Chaat, Bhel Puri, and Eggplant. Eggplant and Bhel Puri were great and the Samosa Chaat had a blast of flavors--- we LOVED the Gol Guppa. For our entrees we got the Onion Naan Chicken Tikka and the Tandori Shrimp. Again, oh so yummy!!! I have never had Naan with onion before and after having this, I am not sure I ever will eat it any other way!! We ended up boxing up at least half of each dinner to take home. Guess we over did it little on the apps!So even though we were pretty full, I really had to try the rice pudding. A friend of mine was there a week earlier and she could not stop talking about how amazing it was. My sister was a little apprehensive as she is not really a rice pudding kind of girl. However, it was a hit! I think she even ate more of it than I did.So glad we stopped in! Can't wait to go again."], ["Christina W.", "Let me start by saying, I love Indian food. \u00a0I generally prefer lunch buffets because of all the variety. \u00a0However, I do know what I like so going out for Indian dinner is just fine, too.My husband and our baby boy decided last minute to try out Marigold Maison. In terms of the food- it was ok. \u00a0The garlic naan was delicious. We had the paneer pakora for an appetizer- it was pretty good. \u00a0Most Indian restaurants that I have been to for dinner bring the condiments (tamarind, onion chutney, and mint chutney) on the side. The pakoras came with the sauces drizzled on the plate- an attempt to be fancy, I think. I prefer the sauces on the side because I like to eat them with the bread and my entree.My entree, the vegetable korma, was ok- it was a little bland in comparison to other Indian restaurants. \u00a0My husband thought the lamb chops were really good.We enjoy going out to eat and while great food is number one on the priority list for choosing restaurants, we also appreciate a nice ambiance, as well as excellent service. \u00a0I have been a waitress many times, so I tend to be more on the empathetic side of servers. \u00a0Tonight, I was digging deep and, really, the only thing I have nice to say is that the people working there seemed kind. \u00a0They were really terrible at time management and knowing how to take care of their tables, however.We sat down on the patio and it took about 10-15 minutes to take our drink order. The table who sat down after us got their drinks, ordered an appetizer, and received their appetizer all before the 2nd waiter came to take care of us. \u00a0Waiter #1 was so flustered with what appeared to be a few tables, so he passed us on to Waiter #2. \u00a0We thought it was going to get better from there, but we were wrong. \u00a0It took our new waiter forever to bring us our check. \u00a0We never even got refills on water. \u00a0Bottom line- it's a small restaurant and we were forgotten about from the point of entry. \u00a0The food was just average, so due to the terrible service, we will not return."], ["Joshua W.", "I was amazed with my experience here. My girlfriend orders the lamb chicken Marsala and I had the chicken Vindaloo. Well her lamb was delicious and my chicken was sub par, so naturally I ate all of hers.

I will definitely give this place another chance"], ["WMT W.", "I hesitated in writing a review because this place is soooo good and I did want my little secret spot to get out but it has.

I really wanted to try a bunch of the appetizers but I could see $40 lunch occurring and \u00a0that just wasn't a today thing.Great service, bit pricey for \u00a0solo lunch dining and the tables for 2 , tiny,wee bit cramped, though not relevant at the time I was there. The lunch menu is too restrictive ,the leap from lunch price to dinner will limit how much I could spend, but don't get me wrong this dish is worth the price, \u00a0but 1/2 the serving and a 1/2 naan for $10-12 would hit the sweet spot and make this a regular rather than occasional thing."], ["Tracy G.", "I work in the area and have been meaning to pop in and try Marigold Maison for lunch for quite some time now. \u00a0This place had always seemed to slip my mind when trying to decide where to go. \u00a0However, I assure you that will not happen again. \u00a0We stopped in today and were blown away. \u00a0The food was SO good... great flavors, perfect textures and good portions. \u00a0The wait staff was very attentive, helpful and friendly - as was the Manager. \u00a0I understand there can be quite a wait for dinner - so you'll need to be smart and make a reservation or plan well ahead to order take out - \u00a0but the wait will be well worth it. \u00a0This will be my Go To when I'm in the PV area from here forward!"], ["Mirza D.", "I love the food and used to frequent this place quite often.

When I suggested that we could sit outside his response was that it was too hot. Upon telling him that we don't mind he replied that he only had one bus boy. I will never understand why Steven was so adamant about turning us away but Marigold Maison has lost a loyal customer. Steven should not deal with customers as he does not have a single customer service bone in his body."], ["RM K.", "Oh my!! Really wonderful food. Some of the most attentive servers around.

Normally, I don't feel the need to write a review so fast, but I AM STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS AMAZING RESTAURANT I found the Marigold on yelp, and my parents and I decided we would try it out tonight. Our waitress Gina was absolutely wonderful. She went into detail about the menu, telling us what was her favorites as well as the chef's and recommended different meat combinations. Let me tell you, as a lover of Indian food, I have NEVER had better indian food in my life. The tandoori chicken came out perfectly moist where at most places it is dry. The Saag was so flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. We also had the BIryani, which was so different and tasty. As an appetizer, order the seared eggplant it was OUTSTANDING! However, besides the food, I was moved by just the general kindness of the staff at the Marigold. Gina was so kind, and was constantly checking on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. The chef came out while we were eating to see if we liked the food, and to tell us about his cooking. You can tell that he takes great pride in his work, and rightly so. \u00a0I will most definitely be returning when I am in the Scottsdale area!! Thank you Marigold for a wonderful dinner!"], ["Tyler K.", "Lunch with friends was great. The service was spectacular and food delicious.

Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd. buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about. Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming. Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at \"Andy's Place\", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...A side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their \"dinner was good but they miss the buffet\". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are \"fraudulent\" and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay/Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners. Ok off my soapbox. Go to Marigold Maison and tell them a Yelper sent you!"], ["Nora K.", "Stopped here on a whim and happy I did. Sat outside because the weather was beautiful and the inside seemed small and hot. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive and, because the menu is slightly different from some more traditional places, the server explained how things come out and portion sizes, which was helpful.Lentil soup was pretty bland and came out warm, not hot. Samosas were great and came out extremely hot. Chicken tikka masala was the entree and it was really good, but not the best I've ever had. This place is worth trying."], ["Christina M.", "I have had better and the Chicken Korma tasted more like Curry chicle the lentil soup was like paste. It was expensive and not very good. I have had better Indian."], ["Jennifer O.", "I love Indian food. There, I said it. The problem? There just aren't that many great places here in Phoenix to get it. So when I saw a new Indian place open and get such rave reviews, I was excited. My mom and I decided to meet here for lunch last week. This place was a little hard to find, but it is on the NE corner of Tatum and Cactus (I went to like every other shopping center first... *palm to forehead*) and it faces cactus (by the Olive Garden sort of). When we entered, my first thought was, oh cute... my second thought was... this place is owned by Roka Akor's restaurant group... that's...weird. Anyway, the owner greeted us and that is when things started to get weird. The owner is a talker... he said so himself... and the things he talked about were a little off putting for a restaurant owner... he talked about politics... people walking by the restaurant.... his old chef who stole from him.... karma...you name the awkward conversation topic to have with a stranger, he probably talked about it. I would say this isn't advisable for a restaurant owner... it's not like we came here to hang out with him, we came here to eat. Speaking of eating, my mom and I shared a Thali and an order of samosas. I was excited they had Thalis (not many places that I've been here do). The thali is like going to an Indian buffet when you are on a serious diet... you get to taste many items, but just a small amount of each. The Thali consists of 3 'main' dishes - you pick the protein for 2 of them and the third is a mixed veggie curry. They allowed us to mix the lamb vindaloo with the chicken masala (after a little nudging from me and agreeing to pay the higher price - 14$). The lamb was very good, tender, just the right amount of spice. The chicken was also tender, but kind of bland for Indian food.... I guess at dinner you can choose your spice level, but not the case at lunch. The veggies were alright... nothing great, nothing bad. It also came with salad (meh.. salad is salad), two scrawny pieces of plain naan (again... nothing special), rice, and a fried dough ball soaked in sweet syrup (I was kind of sad since reports on here said it used to come with rice pudding... I love rice pudding, the dough ball is just ok). The real star of our meal were the samosas... these things were hot, crispy, and well seasoned. Will I be back? Eh, maybe if I were in the area, my mom really enjoyed it, but overall I thought it was just ok and far more expensive (and less delicious) than some of the lunch buffets out there."], ["Sheryl V.", "Disappointing...both my husband's vindaloo (ordered spicey) and my aloo gobi were insipid. \u00a0The chai was not hot and not very tasty. The naan was dry. It was noisey and not the place to dine if you want to enjoy dinner conversation. They automatically added 20% tip to tab. Service was fair .. The pappadam were good. \u00a0No kheer on the menu. \u00a0Won't go back."], ["Crystallynn S.", "If there's anything I love as much as coffee... it's indian food. This place is beyond legit.

However, they fall short on a few areas I'm not happy with. First, with all the spices they are cooking with, they have extremely poor air circulation hence you smelling like what you and the restaurant order by the time you walk out. And that scent is so strong that I couldn't even cover it with perfume and I always put my hair up prior entering knowing I'd smell after! Secondly, they skimped me on the rice. I usually go in by myself and order one entree, that's fine. BUT! I was really hungry one day and ordered two entrees to myself both were supposed to come with white rice. They came out with both entrees and the SAME amount of rice as when I usually order one entree with rice. When asked they said I could pay extra which I found inconsiderate because I ordered a SECOND dish that is supposed to come with its own side of rice. They generally serve the rice in one bowl, which is fine, but they did not put any more rice in that rice bowl than they did when I came and ordered one entree! I was extremely disappointed when I left that day. I had to go to trader joes to buy some extra naan for the second entree... :( I also cannot say the two women always working there were the nicest or most hospitable of servers."], ["Adrienne E.", "Terrible Customer Service! Two hours late delivering my food and they refused to cancel the order. \u00a0The person who answered the phone kept telling me the food would be there in 45 minutes after I waited for an hour even though I was asking to cancel the order. They refused to give me their name and they refused to give me my money back. Then! Worse! They refused to let me pick up my order instead!! I am furious! There are dozens and dozens of Indian restaurants in the Tempe/Phoenix area. The Dhaba will not be seeing me again, and I will tell everyone this story. Spend your money at one of the courteous Indian restaurants instead."], ["Tzarina W.", "I've been here a few times and always enjoy each visit. First of all, when you walk in you get an inviting feeling from the smiles \u00a0and courteousness of the staff. You get to experience a bit of the culture with the lovely dining set they have and by the look of the decor. And of course, the many flavorful dishes that they offer! Their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled. That's an A+ :)This time around I tried papadum which is a \u00a0starter. It looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder, rice powder and some different spices. You can practically eat these non-stop! Favorites/Chicken/Tandoors/Bread/Dessert:- Rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices. You can eat this with their saffron cumin rice. - Gudaspuri Mutter Paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices. Great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake! ;) palak paneer (spinach and cheese) is also good. - Gazab Ka Kadahi Murgh which is a BBQ boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt. This is my new favorite dish because it's baked in their clay oven. Once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt sauce and mixed with onions, bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce. - Tandoori Murgh (chicken) cooked in the clay oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon. - Pani Puri which is small finger foods. \"Street food\" \u00a0Little chip-like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick peas. Pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce. - Garlic Naan is hands down my favorite garlic naan I have tasted!! If you're wanting garlic naan then come here to eat it. It's soft \u00a0,airy, fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top! - Ras Malai (sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks) homemade dessert. Think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture. Really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream sauce. - Halwa which is a Carrot fudge (sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios, cashews, and golden raisins. Really innovative for a homemade dessert! Overall I loved this place because I can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and I can always expect great friendly service from their staff. Gotta come check this place out!

For that accommodation, I added a star :) The location is in a rather \"scruffy\" side of town (not sure I'd want to hang out there after dark). When I arrived to pick up our food at 6pm, there was only one table occupied in the restaurant. We ordered two chicken tikka masala dinners--one mild and one medium in spice level. However, both looked and tasted exactly the same...very bland. Each meal consisted of about 4-5 small pieces of chicken with a cup of basmati rice. We also split an order of garlic naan, which was good. Now, we've eaten at a few other Indian restaurants before, and never once have we been able to finish our meal in one sitting; we always have leftovers.

For the main course we got the Dhaba chicken curry with aromatic basmati rice and some garlic naan. This dish was delicious. The chicken was boneless and tender, the curry was rich with spices and heat. The garlic naan was fresh and pillowy and worked great with the curry.

The Dhaba is OpenTable friendly, so I made a reservation and we were sat immediately. We also found a Groupon, $18 for $30, so dinner was already $12 off before we walked in the door. It was a Saturday night, around 7pm, and the place was practically full. My wife and I noticed that there were a lot of Indians eating here as well, which is always a good sign of authenticity! We couldn't help but notice the numerous placards and \"Best of...\" awards hung all around the entryway. While this place was new to us, it certainly wasn't new to the area and has won many prestigious awards. There was one hostess who also took orders while 3-4 other servers brought out food, refilled water, and pre-bussed the tables. We never needed a refill, never had dirty plates, and were always taken care of. This was a wonderful aspect of our dinner. My wife and I decided to try our favorite Indian staples: Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala (Heat index - 6), Tandoori Chicken, Saffron Biryani Rice, and Garlic Naan. The food was wonderful. My wife enjoys a milder heat so we settled with a 6 on all our dishes (out of 10). The heat was calm with just enough *umph* for her. The flavors were delightful as I mixed them together. Tandoori Chicken in Tikka Masala sauce with garlic Naan bites. Yummerz! The presentation of the dishes looked beautiful and the servers were attending to our every need. We were very impressed with the customer service.If you are in the Tempe neighborhood and looking for a wonderful Indian food restaurant, please check this place out. They are outstanding. My wife and I prefer this restaurant to the many other Indian restaurants within the area, and will definitely find our way here again!"], ["Ayyad K.", "Only Indian restaurant i tried in the PHX area, I liked the food and the ambiance.

I'm glad I got an appetizer because the food took almost 30 minutes. Also, the servers just tend to their own things rather then asking the customers if they need anything.

Would recommend It to others."], ["Sandnya D.", "This place has terrible food, people that is not Punjabi food! It is bland and does not have flavors. Even the Rotis were mediocre. Do not be mislead by the awards, this place is not authentic at all. The worst was the tandoori chicken, could they had added more color! Never going back and you should neither. Service is not great either, they did not change the plates after the starters and looked shocked when we asked them to. We needed to ask for water so many times! Not worth the four stars!"], ["Julie U.", "The Dhaba is by far my favorite Indian food restaurant! I always get the vegetarian or seafood dishes and they never disappoint.

The yellow and red interior was large, dim lit, and good for groups. The buffet items were stacked in the back, followed by a bar area, TVs, booths along the perimeter, and tables located from front to back. Rice and vegetarian items, the meat dishes, chai, and a small salad and dessert bar culminated the buffet line. Both the White and Vegetarian Biryani were disappointing. The rice was overcooked, soggy, and had an unusual flavor. The Sagg was creamy, flavorful, could come with less grease, but still worthwhile. The Turka Dall came with a nice kick, and I really enjoyed the firm delicious Paneer that was worth the repeat. The Tandoori Chicken had a very pleasant smoke, and the meaty pieces came with great temperature without it being dried out. The Lamb Curry was also outstanding. The bulky pieces of Lamb were moist, flavorful, and of quality. The same could be said about the Chicken Tikka Masala. I loved the centrality of charred and smoky flavors that coupled with my vegetarian options to round out the taste buds. The Naan were not greasy, and the spongy textures were addictive. The dessert options were really lacking, and the Chai Tea was diluted without much flavor. For those looking for a spicy fare, I used cilantro chutney to add some unrelenting flavors to supplement the lack of heat across these dishes.Despite the hits and misses, it was a nice discovery. Service was warm, friendly, and these practices were underscored by occasional drop off of fresh naan, and taking away our used dishes in a timely manner. Overall, the food was delicious and the quality of the meat met our expectations. The few limitations were the overcooked soggy Biryani, lackluster Chai, and options and flavors that catered to the conventional Western taste buds. Based on my experiences with other Indian restaurants in the area, this is one place that is worth of returning."], ["Melissa P.", "We have eaten here several times and never disappointed.

The onions have a wonderful flavor. The Chicken Tikka Masala has to be my favorite dish but the Lamb Vindaloo is a close second. I went there for lunch the other day since I work close by and it was a buffet with a good variety of dishes. There was also a hot chai tea that was very flavorful and spicy plus a rice dessert that was pretty yummy.

Sometimes a little too well done but tasty nonetheless. Their chicken is fairly consistent as far as tenderness goes in their masala and Makhani dishes. Their lamb is a little overdone when I've ordered vindaloo but the spice, taste and service makes up for these minor things (which may not even be an issue to others.) Overall the food, service and price are fantastic. My only complaint would be that the location is not so great and it is easy to miss if you're not sure where you're looking for it. I really like this place and the setting is ambient and service is always happy. Our boys love the food too - especially to gulab jamun and chicken makhani.I've also had their buffets recently and I have to say that the buffet is fantastic. It was about an hour before lunch closing and I was a little skeptical that I'd get the last of the food with it being dry and crusty.

I think ~6 different curries (and this is just curries, they have other dishes) that they have at one time is a lot but to others it is not. I somewhat understand that but this is not Las Vegas and it is $8.99. I still give it 5/5 because I am one of those people who go to a buffet and eat platefuls of what I like.

Tons of food, even took home leftovers, and very reasonably priced which is great as Indian food tends to be pretty pricey generally. I had a glass of Malbec and she had lemonade. We walked out for $22/ea and they even brought us a couple of small complimentary deserts to share! Service was exceptional, I think our server was one of the owners. She checked several times to make sure we were enjoying the food. I told her it was some of the best I had ever had and she said \"if there is ever anything not to your liking please just let us know and we will fix it\"! The only drawback for them is they are in the corner of a strip mall and a bit hidden. Well worth the \"hunt\" though! Also the restaurant was very clean, including the restrooms (way important to me), and had lovely colorful decor.

Tucked in the corner of the center, India palace is a good place to go to for Indian food. I ordered the chicken tikka masala plate with a side of rice. The rice is well cooked and the spice in it is very fresh. The chicken tikka masala is different from the usual ones I've had. It's sweeter and the part of the chicken is different than the chunks you get elsewhere. It's very soft and retains the taste of the chicken well. The sweetness is kind of odd but it is interesting. I don't have a big sweet tooth so I would prefer it to have had a stronger spice taste instead. That being said, the sweetness did complement the sauce well. Pros: - They give you a lot of rice. - You can choose how spicy the dishes are. I love that. - It has a really good Indian feel to it. It doesn't feel fake or a front. Cons:- The fans!!!! Holy Molly. \u00a0The ceiling fans spin around under the lights. So you have a shadow of the moving fan moving in a strobe like effect. Gave me a headache. - Not really a con but could be annoying to some: the TV was quite loud and distracting with Indian music videos. I don't mind myself. I feels like it gives it a homey vibe. Bottom line:Good food and wonderful service. They came up to my table just enough time to show me that they were attentive without feel like I was being smothered. Honestly it would be a five star if it weren't for the strobe light effect.

We decided to try India Palace because of the Yelp reviews (don't know how I didn't find this place sooner) and I was REALLY in the mood for some Indian food and (thankfully) my boyfriend has begun to appreciate it more and more so we decided to try a new place. I had only been to 2 or 3 other restaurants in the Valley since I moved here and I thought I had found my go-to...well, turns out, I have a new one. We learned that this was a new location for the business, that they had moved recently from a location they had been in for years. We thought it was decent, well decorated, we were comfortable there. It was really slow and we wondered why, but whatever - better service for us eh?And it was! Besides the food being SPOT ON - the service was so attentive, personal and friendly we not only had our tummys warmed by the culinary loving but also our spirits by just having some nice conversation with our server (whom we didn't get her name but she had just moved to Phoenix from Flagstaff where she worked for their location there which we are definitely making note to try next time we go up North!). For our visit, we stuck with some of my usual Indian faves - Shrimp Curry (medium heat) w/ Garlic Naan and Basmati rice and then the MIXED TANDOORI GRILL (OMG, best I have had, served on a sizzling plate with vegetables and onions, tender and not dry). We had a little RICE PUDDING with some INDIAN TEA to finish which was a perfect combination.

Lamb curry was perfectly spiced with tender pieces of lamb, and the potatoes were a nice touch. Naan came out hot, crispy and garlicky, great for dipping into the curry. Mango Lassi was not watered down and was the real deal. I actually had to ask for extra ice to dilute it because it was so thick, yay more lassi for me!Price is pretty standard for a indian restaurant, but I'd want to come for the lunch buffet and try out some other dishes (chicken tikka masala, biryani).Can't wait to come back!"], ["Tai Vati B.", "Great food here!

Samosa sitting on dripping oil pan,2) Tandoori chicken was not from tandoor but from a frying pan, probably after they did their first round, for the second round they just deep fried them again in oil. And boy that red color is going to cause cancer.3) There were no meat pieces in lamb curry, nothing had the flavor though the ingredients were there. 4) Tea in the cattle was also probably sitting there for an hour or two.5) Saw carrot halwa again loaded with food color so passed it.6) Rice pudding was just boiled rice dropped in milk, I passed that too.7) Naan was to come to table I thought that maybe made fresh. but nope they had already cooked them so I asked him to touch and see how flat and cold it was.8) The guy behind the bar had his laptop playing some hindi news video loud while some sad song was going on On desi TV (so cacophony did not help either.)9) I almost fell as there is a floor drop after the buffet counter and no warning signs.Finally I had to tell the owner that this is horrible, he offered to bring more naan (hot) but I did not want to microwave the stale food so left.

Although I'm not the Indian food expert, I know they had dishes like tandoori chicken, samosas, a few different curries, lamb and plenty of other options including fresh fruit and if I can remember correctly a salad. They also have spiced rice available and garlic naan that is served hot to your table. Make sure to ask for the naan though, as it is made to order versus being out at the buffet. My favorite of their items was one of the yellow curries, the samosas, and the spiced rice. Their tandoori chicken was also really good, but I feel like I've had better at similar mom and pop Indian restaurants. The service was stellar.

I was expecting the food to get better when they raised the price, but they did not. During my most recent visit, there's no longer lamb, the naan was over-charred, and the tandoori chicken doesn't taste as good anymore.What happened here? Nandini used to be cheaper and better!

I happen to agree with others that you really shouldn't have to pay for rice with your entree...but I've found that one order of rice is plenty for two people to share, so that helps.

Very garlicky and not too oily (some other restaurants make their Naan with quite a bit of lard).The only thing that I could really ding this place on was the cleanliness. The linens looked like they hadn't been laundered in years (and were quite dirty) and some of the \"clean\" dishes I grabbed for on going to the buffet table wasn't actually clean.Overall, I would definitely say give this place a chance based on the Indian cuisine but would really recommend you bring some wet wipes to clean your table beforehand."], ["Masta' C.", "I was contacted by the owners after posting my initial review a few months ago, where I had rated Nandini a much deserved 2 stars. \u00a0The owners asked me to return and even offered me a free meal, which is more than most restaurants will concede these days and was greatly appreciated, but I wanted any future visits to be on my terms, so I cordially declined their free food and promised I would return on a day of my choosing. \u00a0Well, today was that day. \u00a0I returned to give Nandini a second chance and took both friends and family with me to gather their opinions, as well. \u00a0The consensus? \u00a0In some ways, the experience was better than last time. \u00a0In other ways, it was largely the same.Compared to my first visit, the food was somewhat better tonight. \u00a0The Paneer was in cubes, rather than the ground up curds we received the first time. \u00a0The Makhani, although still seriously lacking in spice and flavor, was far less overbearing on the butter and cream elements, which made it easier to eat and easier on the stomach afterwards. \u00a0The Tikka Masala was still only \"ok\", also lacking in spice, but was far better seasoned than the Makhani and one of the better dishes we tried this evening. \u00a0The chicken in the Tikka Masala was cooked well and there was plenty of it to go around. \u00a0Additionally, the Naan was made much, much better than before and it wasn't burned. \u00a0The Garlic Naan had no hint of Garlic seasoning, but the Paneer Naan and plain Naans were as expected.The Samosas Chaat tasted great, possibly the best dish we received, but it was far from perfect. \u00a0The Samosas themselves were very hard and there was so much sauce on the plate (and so few chickpeas) that it was more like Samosa soup! \u00a0Nonetheless, the taste was there and the extra sauce, though a bit unattractive and messy in appearance, tasted great on the extra Naan and rice we had left over.Service was slightly better this time, as well. \u00a0As before, only a few tables came in while we ate and one server was tending to everyone, but the pace was perfectly acceptable and we never felt neglected by our server. Food arrived rather quickly and the atmosphere was much as it was before...plain and casual, but reasonably comfortable.My conclusion...Overall, the prices at Nandini are still quite high for the quality of food and while the dishes were generally more palatable then before, they weren't without flaws. \u00a0The curries, which were among the most expensive items on the menu, remained very \"one-dimensional\" in flavor compared to most Indian food I have eaten here and in India.Still, there were enough improvements to the overall experience that I feel I can increase the star rating from 2 to 3 stars, meaning Nandini is \"good\" in my book, but not \"great\" and certainly not \"excellent\".I appreciate the owners reaching out and expressing their concern after my initial review. \u00a0That meant a lot to me and is largely why I gave them a second chance. \u00a0As for the likelihood that I will return again...only time will tell. \u00a0There are certainly better Indian restaurants around, especially for the price. \u00a0However, Nandini is far from the worst. \u00a0Perhaps I will return later this year to see if things continue to progress at Nandini. \u00a0Until then, I hope the owners will take my words to heart and continue to improve the quality, flavor and overall value of their food."], ["Marcie B.", "Love their lunch time buffet for just $10. \u00a0The bread is awesome too. \u00a0Environment is casual, very simple and clean. \u00a0 Highly recommend this place."], ["Kelvin O.", "I had the Entertainment coupon and had to try their dinners.

The staff treats women with less respect, the employees walk around with poor hygiene and like they hate their job. They let a homeless man walk around while people are eating. I am fine with the man getting water but at least don't have him come in every five minutes and make the guests feel out of place. When we ordered our food the server asked what bread we would like. I asked if it was included and didn't tell us how much it was extra. So when I got my bill they not only forgot about taking off the groupons but also pointed out rudely to me (a woman) that the fine print said one per table. I used to be a server and you never are rude to a customer nor do you charge them something without them knowing about it first. So the groupons were never used or given back. So a $20 dinner turned into a $50.

I am so glad that I moved right down the street from Nandini because they bring great, delicious food to the table.I first tried this restaurant on August 28th for dinner with my boyfriend. When we were seated we got complimentary pink lemonade and some papadum to share. We ordered the Chicken tikka masala, baingan bharta, naan, and rice. Everything came out in a timely fashion and was nice and hot. The naan tasted like it had just come out of the tandoori oven. The flavors were delicious and right on target. As we finished up, we got some complimentary gulab jamun for dessert. I walked out that night one happy girl.Finally, on September 14th I got to come back to try the lunch buffet. They had all of the classic favorites out plus a few other dishes. Expect to see chicken tikka masala, shahi paneer, palak paneer, chicken vindaloo, dal makhani, among others. You can choose either basmati rice or vegetable biryani. They also have some desserts such as gulab jamnu, rice kheer and carrot halwa. Another plus of the buffet is that they have self-serve mango lassi and give every table garlic naan! What more could you ask for, for only $6.99 a person?!? So inexpensive for such a great deal of food and drink.I have already been there 4 times (3 times in 2 weeks) and don't plan on stopping anytime soon.

Finally a restaurant that does not serve you the same curry base with different names.The Handi Chicken and Chicken tikka masala were spot on, boneless pieces of chicken in gravies that were near perfection.The gravy reminds one of authentic Pakistani cuisine.The garlic Naan was fresh and full of Flavor(All gravies are served with plain Naan).The restaurant is very basic and ambiance is just about adequate.It's definitely not a place where one goes for a date night.I would recommend getting the food to-go.Also i was very impressed that the food was first boxed in containers and then sealed with poly sheets to avoid any spillage(which is very common when you box curries).The Staff is friendly and was happy to substitute the Naan for rice.Free Samosa when you check-in on Yelp.Cheers!"], ["Evan B.", "To settle any confusion this place is next to Zam Zam world foods, they even share an internal door. For lunch it is a sit down place with a waitress and a menu. The Menu has many familiar Indian items, a few Mediterranean items and the more exotic Afgan items. I was hungry and went with my Afghan fall back the Gulpi (7.50) A Cauliflower dish with a slightly creamy flavorful sauce. It comes served with Tandor bread which in this case they use Naan and for $1 you can get rice which I did. The rice is pretty intresting in itself long grain and colors varry a bit. Over all a great dish but a bit more acidic than I am used to.My friend had a intresting dish that is hard to describe other than it had meat inside dough and lots of sauce. He liked it.Most items will break the $10 mark with tip and tax so I may not be doing this place for lunch too often."], ["Trent K.", "I am a huge fan of the boneless chicken handi. \u00a0I have never seen it offered anywhere but here and it is delicious. \u00a0The naan bread is also the best around. \u00a0The chicken tikka (grilled chicken) is awesome too, anyone even less adventurous boring eaters would love this.The chicken tikka masala was below average IMO.The sunday buffet was not worth the price the one time I checked it out. \u00a0Stick with the menu options."], ["Ariel D.", "Went for dinner and got vegetable samosas, paneer Tikka masala, aloo gobi, rice and garlic naan. \u00a0At most Indian restaurants that would set you back at least 40$ but it only cost us 25$!!The samosas were awesome. The pastry was light and airy and the filling was delicious, but the best part was the green dipping sauce it came with. So. Good.I was a bit disappointed with the tikka masala it was pretty oily and very tomatoey. \u00a0I like it to be creamier and a little sweet. The aloo gobi was good but could have used a bit more spice."], ["Fazle H.", "This place was pretty good, \u00a0service was great, \u00a0and atmosphere was loud (minot detail), but it was very hot inside. \u00a0I mean it was sweaty hot. The food itself was pretty good, \u00a0but nothing to rave over. \u00a0It was pretty close to authentic paki and afghan food. The nehari want really nehari, it was more like beef curry. The goat paya (hoof) was more like what nehari is supposed to be. \u00a0There was one major flaw that stuck out but it was quickly corrected. \u00a0Let's be real mistakes happen. \u00a0If I came back, \u00a0it out be for take out. It's just too damn hot inside"], ["Rand H.", "= = = = \u00a0SUNDAY LUNCH & DINNER BUFFET! \u00a0= = = =Ever since the great Kabab Palace Buffet in Tempe changed over from Afghan to Indian food we have had such a dearth of Afghani Buffet here in the Valley! \u00a0Yes there was Pak Afghan right here for a while, but when I dined with them the menu leaned toward Pakistani... \u00a0good food, but not quite the real deal to me. \u00a0Well, today all that has changed! \u00a0Hitch your camel out front and step into Tahoori Grill here for the real Kabul experience! \u00a0Today I started with some hot tea and Puri, a deepfried bread with which to wrap in some warm Halwa (Khoa) paste and a super tasty chick pea dish. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0Next it was on to some typical South Asian salad Raita, and then to a seasoned rice dish with goat meat, Beef Nihari, Chicken Curry (different than the Pakistani/Indian version), Beef Keema, Chicken Hamdi (Yum!), Chicken Tikka, a great scalloped potato dish and more, plus Phirni pudding for dessert. \u00a0Both the dining room and the service here are a little odd, but that just adds to the authentic vibe of the place and now much of the food is distinctly Afghan here, making this is a special place... \u00a0and don't let me forget to say that everything I ate here today was DELICIOUS! \u00a0 \u00a0 :-))Sunday Lunch & Dinner Buffet: \u00a0$12.99 including hot tea and soft drinks."], ["Steve R.", "This place is amazing! The variety of food is excellent with every dish having its own powerful unique flavor. Not only that, but the family that runs this restaurant makes you feel right at home. Definitely recommend this restaurant and have even turned all my Co workers to it! Word is quickly spreading about this place in my own circle. Try it out and continue to spread the word! P.s. Sundays they have a buffet!"], ["Erika B.", "A colleague introduced me to this gem of a restaurant. \u00a0This is our 3rd time coming and we are always pleased with the food and service. \u00a0I love the channa masala and gulpi here, and I'm a meat lover, so these veggie dishes are very satisfying. I have tried masala closer to me in Mesa and I have yet to find anything better. \u00a0Worth the trip to Phoenix. \u00a0It's close to the airport so if you're visiting and have had your fill of Mexican food, stop in and delight your taste buds."], ["Hussein A.", "If I was king of the world tahoora Grill would be my favorite place in the world, their food is the best I have ever had. \u00a0I love the Nihari, chicken tikka, and Afghani food the \"Bolanee\" Phirini, is perfect tasted dessert I ever had every thing is almost perfect.. \u00a0The buffet on Sunday's wow wow wow amazing: The service is also spectacular. The waiters are Very respectful to elders and anyone else and they're \u00a0cool..  \u00a0 The most important is to know that whatever is so good; that whatever always got haters the most haters you have the more better you are so never give up on your food; you guys are the Gods of foods. Looks like I said a lot but truly that's what I feel about Tahoora Grill. And I can't wait for your live BBQ which is starting soon. Keep it up guys !!!"], ["Gwen O.", "If you love Indian food, but you're looking to change it up, this is your place. \u00a0Everything we had was delicious. \u00a0It may sound boring, but order the samosas... the pastry is so perfect on these. \u00a0Loved the vegetarian options. Only negative I'd say is that the grease level was a little too much for me, but not enough to dock any stars. The flavor of their dishes is spot on... so well seasoned, and that's what counts for me. This place is definitely going to be in our regular rotation."], ["Julie T.", "One star knocked off for a lack of ambiance and no liquor license, but don't get me wrong ... this is five star food, promptly served by nice people!"], ["Danielle S.", "A very welcoming and family owned restaurant! The staff made sure you understood how the meal was prepared and made it to your liking. The atmosphere was perfect and the food exceptional!"], ["Kyle S.", "Our office goes to Tahoora at least once a week and it's not hard to see why: the amazing food and excellent customer service. I've tried, at this point, almost everything on the menu, and everything is always fresh, delicious, and authentic.Some of my favorites are the Bandanjan Eggplant, Goat Karahi, and the Chicken Byrani, but the menu is solid all-around.We've gotten to know the owners just because of the sheer amount of times we go and they are really delightful and always incredibly friendly."], ["Catch Me If You Can M.", "Customer ServiceThe greeter at the front desk (didn't meet minimum labor age) failed to greet us, but simply just stood there expecting me to understand what and how to do. In other words, I wasn't sure if this was a sit down place or an order and bring to your table place, or order and come get it place. After an awkward moment, I grabbed a menu and all of a sudden, another employee flew in and said \"I got it\" and he seated us and asked for our order. We ordered after a lot of questions and unhelpful responses. Our food came and the order was incorrect. I explained this to him and he told me that what they had brought out was what I had ordered. Incorrect, and even if I am wrong, remember the customer is always right and he should have gotten it right. I didn't want to cause a scene, so I ate what he had claimed I ordered.False ClaimsThis place should make no affiliation to Afghan food. Yelp should remove the 'Afghan' tag and the restaurant should remove calling certain dishes Afghan. That being said, I asked about the Afghan dish: Kabuley Palaw, which is traditionally a dish of rice with carrots and raisins featuring lamb or sometimes beef/chicken, cooked and served with the rice. The waiter suggested their version of that dish is a Pakistani skew of ground beef with rice that included carrots and raisins. This is analogous to a pizza and a pizza with no cheese but plenty on the side.Summary and ConclusionAverage Pakistani (strictly speaking) food with confusing service and false claiming Afghan dishes."], ["shelina m.", "Best food ever! There chicken handi is to die for... among other awesome dishes. The husband and wife duo are amazing cooks and very sweet people. When ever my dad comes into town it's the first thing he brings up, when are we going to tahoora?"], ["Maria Q.", "Based on such nice comments through yelpers, me n my family decided to give it a try. We went for the dinner. Ordered nihari, mixed grilled platter and the chicken karahi. It was not a busy day but still twice they brought us someone else's order. They were not sure who ordered it. Shows lack of good customer's service skills. Well not a big deal. When our order came out........it was not what we excepted. The chicken karahi was more like curry chicken, chicken boti was inedible bcoz of being toooo salty, rice was bland, and nihari had 5 to 6 hard & tiny pieces which seemed like been boiled & put in the curry. Only thing we liked was seekh kabob. The taste of food was average. It might be just a bad day I hope. Will give it another try. What we really enjoyed was a nice chat with the young guy who was so helpful n friendly."], ["Alyssa M.", "Frequently come here on Sunday for the buffet. Great options, fresh food, and authentic. If there in Sunday also ask for an order of puri which goes great with the Chana. Enjoy!"], ["Patty B.", "This restaurant is located in a very low key, unassuming neighborhood. \u00a0I would not have ventured there except for the fact that there were many good reviews. \u00a0What an amazing experience. \u00a0The food was unique (for me), flavorful and incredibly delicious. \u00a0I wish I could list the food by their names, but as an appetizer we shared a dumpling-like dish with wonderful tomato / yogurt like sauces. \u00a0We also had a chicken stew (in a red sauce) and the beef kabob. \u00a0Even the rice was perfectly prepared and seasoned. \u00a0This restaurant made my week!"], ["Tom W.", "Total ripoff. Ordered nihari beef and got a bowl of broth with three tiny pieces of meat in it. When I asked where is the meat I was told that is all you get and that is what everyone does.
