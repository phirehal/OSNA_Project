{"Desert Jade": [["Crystal T.", "I enjoy coming for lunch, although I no longer work around the area, I still commute across Phoenix to eat here once in a while when the craving hits. I have never been here for dinner but the prices look steep for Chinese food. They have the best tangerine chicken and that's the only thing I have ever ordered. The have cut back on portions over time but there's still enough to get full but not enough for leftovers for dinner like before. You also get a free pot of hot tea with your order. My only complaint is the waitress. There seems to be only 2, a guy and a lady. The guy is always nice and attentive but unfortunately we always seem to get the lady. She is not too friendly so we always just brushed it off as a cultural thing but the last time we were there she didn't even take our drink order. I guess we were fine with that since we ended up drinking water but the whole situation was just awkward since it has never happened to us before. We just feel as if she wants us out as soon as possible. They also box your leftovers for you which I also find awkward but I can live with that. Yes, this place does look like a retirement center at lunch time and I took a picture to provoke it. (There were tons more seniors next to and behind us) We are always the youngest couple and can actually feel our youth being sucked out of us. This does not take away the fact they have delicious orange chicken and will continue to sacrifice my youth once in a while for its yummy crunchiness. P. s. I don't know if kids are allowed there, I have never seen them in there and they don't have a kids menu"], ["Andru R.", "Great old school Chinese place. The food and service is both outstanding. Try the Moo Shoo Pork and the orange chicken!"], ["Jennifer O.", "They're back! I have been a few times in the last few months and must say that Desert Jade is back to 5 stars in terms of food quality. The pan fried noodles are perfectly crispy and delicious. The sizzling rice soup (my new fave item) is flavorful and the veggies in it taste fresh. They still have the husband's favorite sweet and sour chicken (made with chicken that is fried and then sliced... that makes all the difference). The service is still great, in fact, we have been coming to Desert Jade for almost 10 years now and many of the staff members are the same, which is very cool. On top of that, they remember you, have personal conversations with you, and remember your order. You really can't beat the service. Additionally, the food never takes more than 15 minutes to come out. Other notable dishes are the pot stickers (made in house, not my fave in town, but a good solid effort), the spicy red sauce (yummm), and the lettuce wraps. Definitely check them out!PS They still provide hot tea to the table, a nice touch, but they stopped the almond cookies.... this is sort of heartbreaking... bring back the almond cookies pleeease!!!"], ["Jason B.", "lettuce wraps! their version is so on point that PF Chang's has nothing on them. the filling, the lettuce, and the sauce is so on point! It's so good that I can just feast on the 8-9 wraps served on the platter and not even bother ordering anything else. Oh and their hot tea is super flavorful. bravo Desert Jade for keeping it good! :)"], ["Mark H.", "My wife and I love the Desert Jade. The food is delicious and the service was good. We have taken friends there and have never been disappointed. There are at least 10 Chinese restaurants with in 2 miles of them, and none compare! \u00a0I would have given 5 stars but one dining room seemed a little loud. They may try some carpeting in there. Other than that, it is the best Chinese around."], ["Josh W.", "My first thought: This is expensive for American - Chinese food. My second thought: Who cares? Like many of the people on Yelp I am picky about pricing. This place, as noted, is a two dollar sign, but it is exactly that distinction that sets it apart from other restaurants like this. Like Mexican restaurants in the area, there are roughly four thousand places you could get American Chinese cuisine. They range in price and this is probably the high end as far as this type of cuisine goes, but the tangerine chicken will make you forget about the eleven bucks that it costs. This place was a nice reminder that spending an extra four bucks for your meal is usually worth it, especially when you are going to take to the Internet to tell others about it. Also the egg rolls was mad crispy."], ["Fernando M.", "Good food, great price! Good customer service."], ["Daniel S.", "This might just be my new favorite Chinese restaurant. From the pot of tea to the fortune cookies, everything was spot-on. It's a lovely restaurant with great decor and atmosphere (you can hardly tell you're on Indian School). The service was great; the waiters are friendly (they were happy to chat with patrons and make suggestions) and I have to say it: they speak English better than most places. Most important the food was just what you like about Chinese without the little faults it usually has. All the meat and vegetables were fresh and whole without being overlooked or drowned in sauce. \u00a0Tangerine chicken, for instance, is usually little balls of dark meat heavily breaded and soggy with sugary sauce. Here, it's nice cuts of breast lightly coated in a still-crispy shell with just enough of a very flavorful sauce that can be adjusted to your taste. Vegetables were crisp, tea was hot, and dinner was great. I highly recommend this place."], ["Jon S.", "I searched here for best Hot & Sour soup in Phoenix today because I am sick with flu. Was not disappointed!!! The soup is the best i've ever had... Big chunks of shrimp, mushrooms, and just the right amount of spicy. I imagine it's good when you're well, but if you're not... Get here for a delicious bowl of sweet relief"], ["David S.", "Food here is pretty good, definitely one of the best in this area of town. Never disappointed."], ["Diane H.", "We had take-out and loved the food! \u00a0We'd go again the next time we're in Phoenix!"], ["Ree S.", "Mushy pork, shrimp fried rice, sizzling rice soup all fresh hot and very good. \u00a0I was assured no msg in food. \u00a0Service very nice. Highly recommend."], ["Robin K.", "The food is great and the service is even better. The waitress accommodated my seafood allergy by checking with the chef before placing our order."], ["Lauren J.", "If you're craving Chinese (or good food for that matter), check out Desert Jade. I came here on my lunch hour. Service was attentive and food came out really fast. The crowd starting really coming in at noon so I just missed it by coming in a little after 11AM. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken broccoli, which also came with a scoop or rice and an egg roll. Hot tea is also available at each table. I really enjoyed the food and my experience. I will be back!"], ["Shayna G.", "I have been in Arizona for 6 years now and have not been happy with any Chinese food that I have tried until last night. My boyfriend and I went for dinner and it was AMAZING! The food was great and the service was amazing. Everyone was very helpful and made the evening a good experience with good food. I would recommend the beef and broccoli."], ["B M.", "I order take out every time,. Always polite and order is to my liking. I love some Pepper Steak and theirs remind me of the one from a favorite of mine from Chicago restaurant. \u00a0I definitely recommend this place for good Chinese."], ["Tori W.", "It was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I had the spicy beef with vegetables and my son had the Singapore noodles. My sauce was missing flavor as equally my veggies and beef were bland. Hospital food is better. The rice was cooked with too much water so it was mushy, so when I told the server he said he would get rice from a different pot. That means they have two types of rice and they serve the lowest quality first. The second bowl he brought was medium grade long grain rice. Don't eat here!"], ["Haley D.", "Best Chinese food in AZ! \u00a0Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, & delicious food! The mandarin style bean curd is my favorite!"], ["Ruben M.", "I am always up to try new Chinese places but most of times I have been disappointed. \u00a0My friend invited me to lunch and said this place was one of the best and despite the 118 Degree weather outside, this place was great. \u00a0We ordered fried wontons which were cooked to perfection, the crispiness of the chips was like nothing I had before. \u00a0The sauces and ingredients were above par too. \u00a0I ordered my usual sesame chicken and was blown away by \u00a0such a great dish. \u00a0The fried rice was not as impressive and might have just kept the visit from being perfect. \u00a0Definitely looking forward to their takeout soon!"], ["Kate B.", "I love this place! Great Hot & Sour soup, excellent fried wontons and the staff is so nice. My boyfriend and I get take out from here all the time and the front lady is always very welcoming."], ["D H.", "Who in the world and for what reason would any give this place less than 5 stars? We stopped here unplanned to pick up something to go for later. The woman at the front who took our order was so so polite. And I dont just mean polite, I mean GENUINELY polite. She explained how some items we ordered were made a bit different than other places, and brought a piece of the (orange) chicken out to taste. Id say 8 minutes later, barely enough time for me to catch up on Facebook, our food was ready to go. Nicely packaged to take out. She showed me how to eat the lettuce wraps since it was all packaged separately (I knew how but it was still nice of her). So...the food. BEST EGG DROP SOUP AWARD. EVER. Seriously. This may seem minor but I am a soup lover. and chicken lettuce wraps...amazing. The rest of the food we ordered between the 2 of us was all great. I foresee a problem here. This will turn into a weekly visit"], ["Colt L.", "My mom got a suggestion from one of her friends to come and eat at this place. We were feeling in a Chinese kind of mood, so we thought: what the heck?I've never been to this place before, but I've passed it several times. I was excited to try something new and review another place.As soon as we pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that there were a lot of people parked out front. I took that as a good sign.We walked in to the restaurant and I was surprised at how nice it looked inside! I've been to several Chinese restaurants where inside has pink wall paper, and an assortment of Chinese-type figures all over, and out-dated look, with a huge fish tank in the \"wait-to-be-seated\" area. No, this one was pretty snazzy! Another plus. We sit down and our waitress was very nice. She was very cordial, not too chatty. We ordered the honey dipped barbeque chicken and the cream cheese wontons for the appetizer. The chicken thing was good, but there was hardly any cream cheese in the wonton. It was almost just fried dough. We ordered our entrees. Sweet and sour pork, chicken and another chicken plate. I thought that it would have come with rice (the menu said it did) but only the plate of egg rice came out (which we ordered). The price was reasonable. Not too expensive. It was very filling too. The place was okay. It was better than a lot of other Chinese food places out there, but at the same time it was kind of the same. You know? Anyway, I wouldn't rush back to this place. But I would tell others that it's got \"OK\" Chinese food."], ["Nancy C.", "My spicy tofu and vegetable dish was very bland and I trashed most of it because it was a to go order (to eat at home). I had even asked for it to be a 7.5 out of 10 for the hot/spicy level and it wasn't spicy at all. I think my friend got a shrimp dish with fried rice and she thought it was all awful and she \u00a0trashed hers too. It was a total waste of our money and when I called the restaurant they said I had to bring it all back to get any kind of a credit. I wasn't about to dig through the trash. Needless to say, they've lost my business forever."], ["Kitty K.", "Was a little leery about trying Desert Jade for dinner last night. The building on the outside looks old and the half lit sign was not inspiring confidence, but I have been craving Chinese and my hubby and I always go past it it and stare curiously.Lets be clear here, this is NOT an authentic, or anywhere close Chinese restaurant. This is a good old fashioned American Chinese joint, keeping that in mind we tried the Sweet and Sour Pork, Singapore Rice Noodles and Sauteed Shrimp.The food came out FAST, I mean in 10 minutes after ordering we had our first dish on the table. It was hot and fresh, no rewarmed in the microwave junk. The pork was lovely, big chunks of tender battered pork in that great artificial red sauce which was tangy with just the right amount of sweet. The pork was accompanied by nice sized chunks of pineapple and green peppers that still had some crunch, not cooked to oblivion.The Singapore Rice Noodles came in a huge portion, probably enough to feed 4 people. Perfectly done thin rice noodles with lots of shrimp and pork tossed together with a wonderful curry sauce. Not at all greasy or over sauced. We took more than half of the dish home for delicious leftovers.The shrimp dish consisted of a good sized plate of very lightly battered shrimp sauteed with chili peppers and large cut green onions. It looks deceivingly simple but has wonderful flavor much light salt and pepper shrimp but with much less mess as they don't need to be peeled. The server asked us how hot we wanted the dish so we went with a 5/10, we ended up with a nice blend of flavor and heat that was a gentle medium for us. The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant itself is very clean, it looks like it recently got a new coat of paint. Overall for the price the food is quite a good deal.Oh yes in response to another Yelpers review in where he noted all the elderly in the restaurant and wondered if there was a retirement home in the area. Yes there are like 3 of them in very close proximity!"], ["Charles G.", "I went to Desert Jade for dinner after a day of baseball. \u00a0I have to be gluten free so that generally means that Chinese food is out for me (most soy sauce has wheat as the second ingredient listed). \u00a0Desert Jade made almost all of its dishes with gluten free soy sauce so I was able to order a wide variety. \u00a0It was really good food and excellent service. \u00a0The hot sour soup was some of the best I have ever had,and I have had it all over the country. \u00a0The sizzling rice shrimp was also superior. \u00a0I will definitely be adding this to my list of restaurants that I must visit on my next trip to Phoenix."], ["Synia M.", "always super fresh and fast... and gluten free! \u00a0 great neighborhood find. \u00a0yay!!"], ["Corey M.", "Family of 4 dinning.

But NOTHING else would bring me back. The prices are too high, since the food was NOT good. If the prices were lower, I would consider the old \"Well you get what you pay for!\" saying, but I paid $6 for a small bowl of egg drop soup, and it was very watered down and needed seasoning. Then I paid $11 for some chicken chow mien, it was ok, but the chicken was either old, or stringy (or something, it wasn't very good). The restraunt itself was clean, but freezing. I think they had the ac on.... but since the evenings lately have been in the 30's* everyone was already cold. I looked around and everyone was eating with there jackets, sweaters and hats still on. I was wearing my sweater & scarf!

After all, Phoenix is plagued with AWFUL Chinese restaurants. Our entire dinner was bland. The sauce that accompanied the Fried Wontons was insipid and flavorless. Red, thick sauce should be sweet. This was not. Unimpressed. The pot stickers were ok, but nothing special enough to write home about.I was leery about ordering the Tangerine Beef, because I had a rancid dish of the same name from a different Chinese restaurant a couple years ago. Thought I'd give it a go. Bland. Beef pounded into oblivion smothered with a sauce so faint that it cried for flavor. The Sesame Chicken, bland as well, was overcooked and nowhere near as sweet as one should like.The Kung Pao Chicken was the least amusing dish of all. No flavor, no heat, and no veggies. The Mu Shu Pork was ok, but the plum sauce was, again, bland!Now, the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal. Very clean and the lit candles on the tables were a very nice touch.The service was legendary. Very chipper, friendly, and at times amusing. There was an older lady whose job apparently was to take dirty dishes from the tables and only says \"thank you!\" when she does anything near you.I noticed that a great many of the diners were very elderly. Is there a retirement village nearby? Do you not realize that the elderly LOVE buffets and bland food? This restaurant was full of both, and I think it was the army of elderly people with diminishing taste buds who wrote all those glowing reviews.I understand that people have varying opinions and tastes, but come on!

It was not spicy, and the dish had what tasted like a brown gravy on it. If you want unpalatable Chinese, save your money and go to Panda Express."], ["Brett B.", "AMBIANCE: We came here after we heard this place achieved the dean's list on dirty dining. I was going to only give this place 2 stars (see below) but because this place was not dumpy like other Chinese restaurants and actually was clean and comfortable, this was part of the reason why I raised my rating. It reminded me of when I was a kid in 80s and would go to Steak & Ale with my family. It was very dark inside, which I love when it's 110 degrees outside, with dark furniture and windows you can see out of, unlike other Chinese places where they have to keep their windows shaded or blocked out for some odd reason. But this place has nothing to hide. Upon entering it is nice to see a full bar and to be greeted right away. I believe this is a family restaurant, and you can see the pride in the way the place is kept up. It is super clean, not dusty or dingy, and the bathroom is immaculate. Nice touch, even though the sun had not set yet, was the placement of lit candles on EVERY table, and only a few were occupied. I also noticed a fireplace, which must be nice if they light it in the winter.FOOD: one word, BLAND! I just don't understand. From appetizer to entree, everything was missing either sweet, salt, or both. The fried wontons could have a used a lot more filling and the \"sweet\" orangey sauce was not even sweet. What?! The fried dumplings looked like they stuck to the pan, as they were slightly black and some were broken from when they tried to remove from the pan (probably not enough oil, or they walked away for too long). The familiar sauce that came with it was not salty enough so I just used soy sauce. The Kung Pao chicken was unlike any I've had before. Where were the red and green bell peppers? Missing. Where was the heat, even though it was in red to indicate spicy on the menu? Missing. It was just chicken, lots of green onion bottoms, peanuts, and those whole red chiles no one eats but is supposed to add heat. The sesame chicken, usually with a very sweet sauce, was not. The chicken was okay, but slightly overcooked, noticeable by the very dark brown fried coating. I didn't like the tangerine beef: when you have any meat sliced thin, hello, it must be cooked no more than a minute or two or tough, as it was in this case. Think beef jerky. I noticed that the restaurant kept filling up with old people and I thought that maybe a nursing home was nearby, but then it dawned on me; they like bland food so this place was like their mother ship!SERVICE: This also led me to raise a star as the service was stellar. More than a few people from a couple waitresses to several bussers, took great care of us. They even wrapped the pancakes for our mu shu pork dish for us. Everyone is so friendly and served with a smile, I so want this place to succeed. Yes, you are in Phoenix and the pickings are slim for the traditional, Americanized, Chinese restaurant that serves the freshest and tastiest food.

The Thai Style Pineapple Fried Rice and Mango Chicken are both great sometimes, and other times just bad. The Mongolian Beef & Beef with Broccoli seem to be sure bets.What keeps us coming back? Well, the portions are a good size, and sometimes it's just so damn good. Also, it's never overly greasy, it's so convenient, and the lady who always takes our orders and is there when we pick-up is just so sweet.

There was one waitress and from what i could see, one cook. There were 4 tables of 2, a 3 top and then us 5 adults and 3 toddles.

With the Camelback Light-rail construction all but finished, the City gave her a left-turn lane into the property for Eastbound traffic and the nearby Stargate (have to see it to believe it) for convenient access to diners from other times and dimensions. When the light-rail station arrives, the asshole landlord of this eyesore of a strip mail will no doubt double her rent again, but in the mean time, Jenny's place resides just blocks from home.Jenny (and her family) make you feel like you're sitting at her kitchen table, as she shares with you from the bounty of her generosity and love as your host. That being said, please do not expect a five-star dining experience. As Eric noted, the service can be a bit slow, but It's excellent food, prepared with the best ingredients.Among my favorites are the (1) wor wonton soup (normally an appetizer for two), made red with spoonfuls of hot chili sauce, (2) the chicken noodle soup (which has nursed me to health through many stomach bugs and influenzas over the years), (3) the bbq pork ribs, and (4) the shrimp and vermicelli clay pot dish.As of the writing of this article, her niece had just joined the staff as server and helper. She's a bit green, so cut her a little slack.The Prime is easily the cleanest and quietest Chinese restaurant you'll ever dine in.

I am the bane of the delivery driver's existence.With that confession tossed out there, I ordered from Great Wok tonight. I came home after work, giddy with the thought of a three-day weekend ahead, and realized the only fish I had in the house was a very unappealing frozen piece of tilapia. The woes of Lent. I can't survive off of the wilted English cucumber chillin' in the veggie drawer, so I had to give in and order delivery (I have the horrible tendency of not leaving the house once I get inside and realize how comfortable the couch is. Unless something important is going on, like a hamster fashion show or Chumbawamba's reunion tour. You know. The big stuff), and it had to be either a) vegetables or b) seafood. Chinese clearly fit these categories beautifully.I did not want a repeat of my last Chinese order, so I reexamined Yelp and found Great Wok again. Score. Called them. ...No answer. Determined to have some delicious Diocese-approved dinner (alliteration FTW), I made the fat kid in me chill out and called them again 5 minutes later, spoke to a very nice young guy, and ordered crab puffs, fried tofu with vegetables, and shrimp with vegetables. I hung up and realized I ordered enough for a small army (damn delivery minimums), and as a newly single lady that meant a lot of leftovers.The time estimate I was given was 45 minutes, and the food showed up within half an hour AND the delivery guy did not call freaking out about my gate being closed. (Yesss...I don't have to feel like an asshole.) Gentleman shows up at my door and hands me my food, and I sign the receipt thinking \"This better be worth $26effing94...\"Oh, it was.

The patio looked nice as well, but we opted to sit inside due to the heat and the fact I was carrying a fully \"cooked\" baby.Anyway, on to the food... everything was delicious and unique. I don't think I've ever had food quite like the Clever Koi. The Hubs and I shared a noodle bowl and some small plates. As I recall, the noodle bowl was very spicy, so that was slightly tough for me, but the Hubs thought it was amazing. The small plates we had were so good, pig face dumplings were top notch.

We started off with the calamari fries and steamers. The calamari fries were okay, but the batter didn't have much flavor/seasoning. There was also no lemon or dipping sauce with them.

I wasn't able to get past the saltiness of the dish.We then ordered two steamed buns - pork belly and chicken and waffles. The first thing i noticed was how small they were! My boyfriend could finish one in two bites. And for $4 each you'd think you'd get just a little more. The pork belly one was decent, but the chicken and waffles wasn't so good. The chicken was dry and the waffle bun was soggy and fell apart while you were eating it. The most confusing part of the plate was that it came with a side of dipping sauce? It was way unnecessary and didn't fit with either steamed bun we ordered. Lastly, we thought we'd try the scallop dumplings. Also looked pretty good when they came out, but were also extremely disappointing. I don't know what was in them, but it did NOT taste like scallops, or even seafood. The filling was dry and the closest thing it tasted like was chicken. The sauce on it was confusing. Did not meld well at all. I don't know what kind of flavors they were shooting for, but it was a complete miss.Our meal after tip was over $60 (including drinks). We left hungry and unsatisfied.

My husband and I had been scouring yelp to find an amazing restaurant for our anniversary and stumbled upon this place due to the reviews. Located in a really cool building with lots of rustic wood and glass displaying the kitchen and dining area. I loved the \"sushi bar-esque\" seating in front of the kitchen where you could literally watch them making your food. I had such high hopes upon reading rave reviews and arriving at this place but the food and service did not back up the aesthetics.We were told to wait upon arrival because they needed to \"reorganize\", even though there were plenty of open tables. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated without being offered a menu or drinks. When another couple came in and was immediately seated I asked why we were skipped and she said they had a reservation and she was just about to seat us anyways, coincidentally. Would be nice if their website advertised/allotted reservations so I could have done the same. Not one time while we were waiting though did I see any \"reorganizing\", or moving of tables in the dining room.Upon being seated we were handed menus and I have to say there was a great variety of dishes on the menu that you don't see often. Pig face dumplings and steamed bun assortments. \u00a0That was exciting. I ordered the Tofu soft bun and my husband ordered the Softshell Crab and the Pork Belly buns. As we went to pick our buns up from their holders, the outsides of the buns were stuck! Most of it was torn and stuck to the holders which was disappointing. Maybe lightly oiling the holders or having non stick holders in the future would prevent losing some of your bun. Overall good flavor and definitely the highlight of the whole meal. I would almost suggest ordering a variety of those as your meal, asian taco style.Main entrees consisted of the Roasted corn Ramen for myself and the Seafood Hot Pot for my husband along with plenty of their handcrafted cocktails. 2 bartenders for the whole restaurant was probably not the best idea. We waited a long time for drinks, 15 minutes or more sometimes and thats only because we had to flag down our waitress whom looked a bit lost. It was confusing as well because almost every item was brought by a different waiter/waitress which made it hard to connect with our own server.Roasted Corn Ramen was rich and creamy with great extraction of corn flavor.Just wish they had either allowed me to add the tempura corn on my own or left it to be plated on top last minute because it was really mushy in the ramen once it reached me and lost all of its crispy crunch. Seafood Hot Pot was lacking in seafood. You can't call something seafood and only put out 2 types of seafood. They should call it shrimp and octopus ramen. Thats what it was. Flavor was there though and the homemade srirachas were a great touch. All in all it was good, not great, no hard feelings but they should focus more on the basics than what will look cool and different."], ["Connie L.", "Missed happy hour by five minutes, but food was still good.

Out of those folks who has actually eaten @ Momofuku? I dare to say (as a chef myself) that the vast majority of technique and flavor development are straight out of David's MOMOFUKU cookbook. From the ramen to the (specifically) pork buns. I am never critical of using other chef's techniques, but in this case its a straight rip off without so much as a simple credit being given. I've made the argument a million times that \"fusion\" is nothing more than \"CONfusion\". Its not so much about the flavors themselves, but their composition \u00a0in regards to the overall dish. Does a bowl of soup really benefit from 4 techniques and 6 flavor profiles spanning 4 continents? Here you get very confused and anorexic portioning coupled with muddled and unclear flavors. The presentation is good enough but for the price I was left wanting. The service was exactly where it should be on the \"hipster\" index. I'm confused as to when exactly in our time service became a luxury... but I digress. Food was dropped off with no explanation of technique or procurement... nor were pairings offered for the food in regard to drink or appetizers. When prices exceed 100 for a pair to eat a normal amount of food the gold standard should'nt be a suggestion, it should be the rule. I doubt this place will be vying for a Michelin star any time soon based on what I saw. I doubt they will even receive accolades in the form of diamonds or stars.I love seeing the community stepping up in Phoenix, but I despise seeing \"straw men\". It's probably the potential being wasted on the talent employed here that has me so worked up... I expect more. Phoenix is a wasteland of food. Too long have the corporate ass-hats peddled their mass produced wares without allowing for any options. The landscape is pallid and bleak... soaked in the beige homogeny that has come to define this area. I was hoping we had a chance at something unique and wonderful. Instead I got disappointment and a bad taste in my mouth. These guys had a real opportunity but I don't see it being developed by the shot callers @ Clever Koi.This review is simply about the food and my suspicions of plagiarism on behalf of the leadership @ Clever Koi. Its just my opinion based on experience, nothing more."], ["Anthony N.", "This place was great! We actually were hesitant to come for a very long time because my sister said she wasn't a fan at all. On a whim my wife and I decided to give it a shot and really enjoyed it!We came on a Saturday night around 8pm. It was full but since we were just two, we sat at the bar which has full service. The bartender who helped us was very nice and helpful. He made some suggestions for us but wasn't pushy about it. My wife ordered a \"Hey Bartender\" which is a custom drink based on your preferences which the bartender asked her about. It was tasty. I ordered their house grapefruit soda. Also awesome and refreshing! For appetizers we ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings as well as the pig face dumplings. The shrimp and chive were our favorite of the two but the pig face was definitely unique and tasty as well. For dinner we ordered the Pork Ramen to split. This is where I could see where my sister thought it was salty. However, I like salty so I'm not a good gauge. My wife really enjoyed it as well and said she'd rather it be slightly salty than bland. Overall a great experience! We will be back for sure."], ["Jon H.", "I don't know how to classify the food at Clever Koi... Chinese? Japanese? Dirty knees, look at these? I don't know... but what I do know is that what ever they're doing, they're doing it right. I first came to CK about a month ago and it nearly, instantaneously became one of my favorite restaurants in PHX.The Food: The first thing that stood out were the Steamed Buns. I love steam buns and the ones here are very good. I think I've now tried all of them. The chicken and Waffle as well as the Duck stick out in my mind the most so I would say try those but none have disappointed. As far as entree's go, I've had the Sweet & Sour (Chicken?) Rice Bowl... I thought I had pork but the menu on their website says it's chicken so whateve's, either way it was delicious. The next time we came, I had the Mongolian Beef rice Bowl... I think the website menu is wrong because I don't see it on there but I know that's what I got because it was just last night. It was great but what sticks out in my mind is the thin slices of something... some kind of garnish perhaps, but either way this stuff was wriggling like they were alive... it was freaky and kind of cool at the same time. PS... it wasn't alive... The Dranks:They make Great cocktails.... The first time I tried the Guns N Rose' because... yeah GNR is the greatest band ever... A nod to CK on the naming... ya got me. It was very good. Not something I'd drink all the time but good. I think the other drink I got was the Rye & Rum Old Fashioned... again, very good. I could have drank these all night long and then later made very questionable life choices.They also have a very good craft beer selection. On my second visit I went with the THAT Brewery Road Rash IPA. I like when restaurants have local beer offerings and there were quite a few the night we went.Let's Wrap it Up: I didn't mention above but the presentation of the food and drink are very nicely done. Attractive without feeling pretentious. I love that. It's a cool place... the atmosphere is very chill and the service has been excellent both times we've been here. All that said, I guess it doesn't really matter how you classify Clever Koi. At the end of the day, the only box they fit in for me is the box labeled awesome places to eat and drink in Phoenix. Cheers!"], ["Megan P.", "The Clever Koi will reel you in with its soul satisfying ramen, cleverly named and crafted cocktails, and modern decor.Walking up to the restaurant, past the artful logo painted on the facade, you'll find large glass windows through which you see trendy Asian inspired interiors abustle with activity. Whether you are in a group or on a date, find yourself a seat and ready yourself for delicious food and drink. The menu has an array of choices from small bites like steamed buns or Brussels sprouts to bowls of piping hot ramen. I settled on the cauliflower ramen with picked persimmon, cashews, and a soft boiled egg, which came on the side in a small bamboo dish. Oh lawd- the silky coconut milk broth, tang of pickled persimmon, tender crunch of cauliflower, and rich egg yolk came together in harmony in each bite. Let's just say there were zero leftovers. The experience was made complete by the excellent bar program with drinks like the Enabler- a delightfully rustic sipper with hickory smoked whiskey, grilled lemon, bitters and maple syrup. The sweetness from the maple played off the smoky whiskey in perfect balance. There are wines and beer too for the those not fancying the hard stuff.By all means, when in Phoenix, step into the Clever Koi for an enjoyable and satisfying \u00a0evening"], ["Janet N.", "Trendy, modern type of restaurant that serves Asian fusion.I had a hankering for some ramen and saw that TCK did a version all their own and decided to try it out. Luckily, it was also happy hour so I got to go for their Pork Ramen priced at $8. I sat at the bar and it was pretty empty, even for happy hour.The Pork Ramen came out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The broth is not Tonkotsu, but pretty simple. I enjoyed the ramen noodles as they were thick with a good chew. The pork belly was good, a bit tough but had this great roasted texture on the outside- almost crispy. Soft boiled egg was good! Perfect portion for ramen as well! Service seemed lacking, but I was checked up on. Probably due to the place being a bit slow at the time, I mean I did seat myself since nobody was at the store front. Haha!Decent food, would've wanted a more complex broth but interested to see what else they have to offer. Their drinks look pretty awesome too!"], ["Amanda L.", "There was a phase in my life where I came here basically every week, because I've never had ramen like what I found at Clever Koi.Whenever I tell my friends that there's a place where I'm willing to pay $13 for a bowl of ramen, I get weird looks. Probably because they think I'm talking about the twenty-five cent college stuff. But no--this is a large bowl of pork broth with pork belly (I swear, it's just giant chunks of bacon. Don't be scared of the word \"belly\"), amazingly boiled noodles, a soft boiled egg, spices, crunchy veggies and deliciousness. And don't get me started on their chicken and waffle steam buns. Or their pork belly steam buns. Or their rotation of tap beers. Or the steaming seafood hot pot. Literally ALL of it is delicious.If you're looking for somewhere to go on a date night, or for happy hour, or lunch--look no further. Go to Clever Koi and understand what I'm talking about."], ["Larissa W.", "I like to research a restaurant before trying it and I was super excited to eat here. I went there tonight with my bf and all in all, I found it disappointing.They cram the people in like sardines, with tables literally having maybe a foot in between one another. It was also incredibly loud. So much so that we had to ask our server repeatedly to reiterate what he was saying while also hearing the conversations, word for word, of everyone in a ten foot perimeter. How romantic.Now to the food. I got the Kung Pao Wings and what I received was...odd. Here I was thinking they'd be like every other chicken wing that I've had at a restaurant. Nope. They serve you the ENTIRE wing: tip, joints, and all. So you get this big, awkward, boney wing with sticky sauce all over. So as I'm trying to figure out how to eat this thing, the sauce gets everywhere; only part of the wing itself is crispy and the other part is fatty and mushy, and overall it was the biggest letdown of the night. I love chicken wings and this was a big disappointment. Staff of Clever Koi: warn people when ordering this dish! My server saw my struggles but clearly did not care or try to make things easier. Thanks man.Next I got the Pork Belly ramen and my bf got the broccolini and beef. The ramen was okay. In my opinion there were too many flavors trying to vie for attention and not all of them were good. The broccolini and beef was delicious, although there were maybe only 3 pieces of beef in the entire bowl. Being a foodie, I hate expecting good things from a restaurant only to be severely let down and out a good chunk of change. Not sure if I'll be back."], ["Victoria S.", "Wow this is the best chicken broth I've ever had ! Seriously I don't know how they do itIt's magical. \u00a0I took my little 92 year old grandpa and all he could say was wow this is delicious so fresh & beautiful. \u00a0The lunch bowl was pretty large we couldn't finish it, they will charge you for extra broth but it's worth every dime. \u00a0The broccoli was fresh and defiantly al dente I can't stand when veggies are limp and loose color that indicates to me that they at are over cooked. The bathroom was clean and Nicely decorated. \u00a0We tried the banana fritters which were very tasty ! Crunchy on the outside rolled in a light sugar nice warm and fluffy on the inside filled with fragrant bananaFive little balls come in a servingI live kind of far from there but I will most certainly be back"], ["Justin C.", "I love The Clever Koi. \u00a0They have a killer lunch special - a $5.00 bowl of ramen. \u00a0After putting all the fancy stuff in it (meat, egg, bok choi, etc) - it comes out to a still-acceptable 10 or 11 bucks. Delicious. Also, the pork belly bun is also excellent.Every time we've been there, we were greeted warmly by the owner and had good service at the bar. The bartenders are also excellent there. I really like the French 95(?) cocktail - a mix of champagne and whiskey. Weird but mighty good. \u00a0They have a good discount on cocktails at happy hour, too. \u00a0Hands down, the Clever Koi is great stuff. I go there as often as I can!"], ["Millie H.", "Been in here three times now. The service is always good and the food is phenomenal! You can tell the owners really put a lot of work into creating great food and a fun vibe."], ["Lana H.", "I love the Clever Koi. We normally get the lemongrass chicken ramen, which is my favorite, and my boyfriend loves the salt and pepper soft shell crab. Normally we pair those with some small dish items (sticky buns, dumplings etc.). The make incredible cocktails that take some time to make, but are worth the wait. The staff is really good at recommending drinks based on your likes. Everything we have ever had is delicious. Most the time we would get irritated at the price per portion for some of the items, but the flavor makes up for it. They also have some awesome weekly specials - two entrees and drinks for $45+. Was worth it for us."], ["Dri N.", "This place is descent but not really if you are Asian or have an Asian taste pallet. The best was the pork belly bun the only... Only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars... \u00a0 \u00a0Granit this place does get packed but to get your food takes some time. \u00a0 Id say this place is fun hang out spot if you can hear well and talk loudly"], ["Courtney P.", "The service is so good here. Beautiful drinks and beautiful bar. And beautiful food! Edamame corn fritters were amazing, loved the sauce. Avocado and tofu bao were great. Wish there was a peanut sauce! Liked the flavor of the corn ramen but don't love the consistency, I wish they had a vegan/vegetarian clear broth rather than a pur\u00e9e type broth. Tofu chow mien was off the charts. Our server Bryce was so helpful. so veggie friendly it's almost overwhelming! Coming back always"], ["Carlos C.", "Amazing first experience at Clever Koi. \u00a0I ended up ordering a brandy and blackberry cocktail named the Little Sheba...pretty delicious. I had the roasted corn dumplings to start and then dug into the shrimp and steak chow mein. I was stuffed but felt a review would not be complete without an amazing dessert. So I went for the bananas foster fritters. \u00a0Let's just say they didn't disappoint and I'll be starting my new diet in the morning. \u00a0As a matter of fact I may come back just for those fritters. All in all a great new spot for me. \u00a0A little far from home but I am starting to venture out and check out new places. I highly recommend this spot and ask for David at the bar. \u00a0Great recommendations."], ["Teresa S.", "This is a cute little place that has not been here too long. But, I am happy they are here. For so long Phoenix downtown has had nothing. So it is great to now have some cool choices around town.First off the Restrooms in here are delightful. There are 2, they are large, and nice and clean.The parking is a little tricky if you don't know the neighborhood. Best parking is around the back. You have to turn down a side street to get to it. Follow the parking for George and Dragon, that makes it easier.I met a friend here for lunch. While I had parked around the back, she does not know the area that well and ended up parking far away. \u00a0But, we came after the lunch crowd, I think it was around 2 so it was not very busy.However ,we did wait a long time for our check and such. Anyway, when I first arrived there was a delightful young man who was so helpful and friendly. I told him I had never been before. So he was kind enough to explain everything to me. About ordering ,where did I want to sit, the food, etc.However, he was through with his shift so we had a different waiter. Still good though.Lunch is a reasonable price. However, I do not recommend if you are in a hurry. Such as your lunch break. It takes a long time to get your food.For lunch all you can get is Noodle bowls. Though you have many noodles types to choose from , as well as different meats or Shrimp. As well as you may add vegetables to it as well as your own type of broth.It was very good, and everything tasted extremely fresh!I am really looking forward to checking them out for dinner. Very beautiful inside as well. Simple ,yet stunning. I liked it a lot!"], ["Mark C.", "Peer pressure can be a powerful thing. \u00a0Particularly when a peer keeps prodding you to pay of a visit to one of their culinary favorites. \u00a0Despite such efforts by her and other peers in the past, I've learned to always temper my expectations and go in with an open mind. \u00a0Oh, I do my homework in advance of course, but I've learned that everyone can have a favorite that might not mesh with my palette the same way it does with theirs. \u00a0In the case of Clever Koi however, there's more than enough great food and drink (as well as great vibes) to satisfy me and all of my peers.Clever Koi occupies one of a pair of newly constructed modern commercial spaces along Central Ave just a few blocks north of Indian School. \u00a0In one building lies Central Wine Bar and Model Citizen Hair Salon. \u00a0In the other lies a beautifully outfitted restaurant with windows galore, a picturesque outdoor patio overlooking Central Ave, and modern furniture throughout. \u00a0But if you really wanna see be where the action is, do yourself a favor and sit at the bar like I did. \u00a0Besides the bartending staff mixing up drinks and commiserating with the customers, the owners (yes, the actual owners) are cooking up all of the restaurant's signature dishes in an open cooking area right up front complete with a smoker, a grill, and full prep area. \u00a0All of it right there to see, smell, and tickle your senses.I came during happy hour when a number of their drinks and signature dishes are discounted. \u00a0I actually tried a couple of their cocktails including the Fish House Punch and the Old Fashioned. \u00a0The Punch included rum, cognac, lemon juice and peach schnapps and had what looked like a little spice blend on top and was served in a clear tea cup. \u00a0Odd presentation, but a very refreshing drink. \u00a0The Old Fashioned was a pretty typical rendition, though I think there was a hint of brandy to go with the bourbon that gave it an extra kick.The Asian steamed bun dishes aren't discounted for happy hour unfortunately, but past experiences at places like Nobuo and Adobo Dragon have taught me that good Asian steamed bun dishes are not to be missed. \u00a0After struggling to pick two I took the bartenders advice and ordered three (I might've been a little buzzed at the time, but I digress). \u00a0I went with the duck confit, chicken & waffles, and soft shell crab buns. \u00a0The chicken & waffles one is actually a piece of syrup covered chicken inside a waffle with kimchi flavoring, so not a true Asian steamed bun in the purest sense. \u00a0It was weird to gaze upon at first, but pretty tasty. \u00a0The soft shell crab also has an odd appearance as the entire crab (claws and all) is there in front of you topped with aioli and cucumber, but that crab was delicious and I loved the fish sauce they put on it. \u00a0But my favorite byfar of the three was the duck confit. \u00a0Ridiculously tender duck and plenty of it complimented by a lightly sweetened plum sauce. \u00a0If you're coming here for the steamed buns, by all means be sure to include the duck confit.For the main event, it was time for a noodle dish since that appears to be Clever Koi's main calling card. \u00a0On their Happy Hour menu is arguably the one noodle dish that probably gets more Yelp mentions and more compliments than any other. \u00a0The Pork Ramen. \u00a0Pork Belly, Kimchi, Hearts of Palm, a hard boiled egg all topping a bevy of noodles. \u00a0First and most importantly, the broth for this dish is out of this world. \u00a0I could've slurped the broth and been completely happy with this dish. \u00a0Seriously, the tender pork, soft noodles, and other cast of characters were a bonus, but the broth is what makes this dish. \u00a0To complete the evening (despite being completely full), I shared an order of their banana foster fritters. \u00a0Basically cinnamon covered donut holes with banana filling inside and a caramel sauce to dip them in. \u00a0Yup, they're as good as they sound. \u00a0I only had two since I was already full beyond belief, but it solidified the experience for me at this CenPho gem.It would be safe to classify Clever Koi as Asian Fusion, but aside from that there's no one description that encapsulates the theme of this place. \u00a0From their vast bar selection of drink and mixed drink choices, to their innovative take on Asian steamed buns, to the complex flavor combinations of their noodle bowls, Clever Koi is unconstrained while still being authentic. \u00a0And the modern aesthetics make this a great place for a date, a group outing, or just hanging out with friends at the bar. \u00a0Total tab for me this night including the two cocktails, 3 steamed buns, ramen bowl, fritters, tax and tip came to about $50. \u00a0The prices for the pork ramen and cocktails were discounted quite a bit for happy hour so I would certainly recommend coming here around then. \u00a0But as I said earlier, even if its not happy hour, I recommend sitting at the bar. \u00a0And let owners Joe, Josh, Jared and Nick make your experience as memorable as it was for me."], ["Karla K.", "Ok...now I am and will remain, out of my comfort zone. \u00a0We had the most fantastic, knowledgeable (and major hottie) server, David, who just took us

Just wonderful flavors, excellent drinks...aaaah!We started with the Pig Face dumplings...sweet baby Jesus! Sooo amazing. Followed by the Shrimp and Chive dumpling...speechless. We just sat there, floored. Then was the Pork Belly steamed bun...Man oh man...not one thing wrong with it. Just perfect.The one mediocre choice was the one that I came up with and, well, we won't talk about it. \u00a0Moving on, we topped it off the with Kimchi Fried Rice...with shrimp and...(wait for it).....pork belly!

The parking lot is tiny, but looks like there is valet later in the day. The restaurant is next to some type of salon and wine place. We got sat at the patio and I love the decor - trendy, earthy, and very relaxing. Our waitress wasn't the sweetest by any means, but we made due. We ordered the pork belly and duck steamed buns, the wood fired grill plate with steak, and the shrimp toasts. The pork belly steamed buns were good, the duck was not - way too dry and lacked flavor. The wood fired grill plate took forever to get to our table, but it was just ok. The shrimp toasts were ok too. We were full and had not left much on the plates for a doggie bag.All in all - I definitely am happy that I came to try it out, but this whole Asian fusion trend is not working for me. Yes, I get the \"trendy\" ambiance, but I guess I expect what I grew up with at asian restaurants - big portions, lots of flavor and sauce, reasonably priced, and you leave with a doggie bag!"], ["Isla B.", "Clever Koi is best!!! I've been here once a week for the past couple weeks and I can honestly say it gets better every time. Everything is amazing...ambience, service, food. I recommend sitting at the bar where the chefs are preparing the food rather than a table. What an awesome interactive experience. We order something different every time and I've never had anything that wasn't incredible, both in presentation and taste. I love this place because of how unique and fun the experience is and I leave feeling beyond satisfied. Always a pleasure, already looking forward to next time!"], ["Daniel L.", "This Asian fusion restaurant has created quite a buzz with their steamed buns and happy hour menu. The frontal open patio can be a great place for hanging out and people watching during the not-so-hot seasons. By extension, the modern, immaculate interior encompasses large see-through glass windows, full bar, rows of tables, and touches of Asian artifacts. The atmosphere is completely hipsterish. Fellow Yelper Tony Y. Jr was in town for a visit, so we stopped by for happy hour and a light meal.The Roasted Pork Belly Steamed Bun ($4.50) was served with hoisin, cilantro, and peanuts. The soft and fluffy steamed buns were addictive, but they were also pre-packaged and not made from scratch. The pork belly was tasty, but could be steeped in seasoning and roasted for a longer period of time. The touches of sauce and garnishes added some depth. It was a decent option, but the taste of the pork belly has to be more striking than it appeared. The Peking Duck Steamed Bun ($4.50) was put together with bacon, mizuna, and charred plum jam. The dry spots on the duck tasted oven baked with confit-like textures. The depth of seasoning was lacking the deep star anise flavors. The sauce and garnishes gave a nice savory and sweet contrast. Again, the duck should be a lot more robust and flavorful to add twists to the soft fluffy buns.The Pork Ramen ($7) comes with braised pork belly, ribs, scallion, mustard green, kimchi, hearts of palm, and poached egg. They recently raised the happy hour prices but should really kept it at $5. The pork belly had a good fatty to meat ratio, but the broth was steeped with mustard green flavor that prevented the pork fat and shoyu to anchor the chewy egg noodles. The runny poached egg was a Western cop out on what is supposed to be soft-boiled egg. For what it is worth, I would only pay $5 for it. I've been here on many other occasions and service was attentive on most of my visits. I didn't get to review their other menu items, but there was overall a breadth of originality that did not translate into the kinds of sharp flavors, depth, refinement, and wow factors expected in the execution. 2.5 stars, I will only return when I'm invited to come hang out with friends."], ["Allen W.", "It's not just about amazing food - The Clever Koi has become an important spot for midtown & for Phoenix. The chefs and owners came from The Parlor, another institution but the Clever Koi also sources local produce and adjusts the menu by season.

The true 5 star restaurant. My husband and I have been here twice and we both agree it is truly our favorite restaurant in the Valley.Location is awesome. While parking is not the best (most spaces are \"reserved\" for George and Dragon patrons only), we always have managed to find a spot fairly easily. If not, they always have valet available. Ambiance is fantastic. Love how it's decorated, the interior design and lighting are great.Service? Some of the best I've ever experienced. David has been our server both times and I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. He's so friendly, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about not only the food menu, but the drinks as well. He can explain every single ingredient of the drink menu to you, from chartreuse to Pimm's to anything else you may not know. If I've had a sweeter, more genuine server, I cannot remember when it was. He remembered us from our first foray in and made sure to say goodnight to us as we left (and let us know the new menu would be coming out soon, yes!). The general manager (who has been there both times we have) is always super friendly as well, running food and always making sure everyone's happy. The bussers are great too (waters were always kept full) and the place runs like a well oiled machine.Drinks were awesome. My husband ordered one that ended up being fairly strong, so David came by and did a few revisions to it, making it absolutely delicious. I had the Temperance Trap (awesome), one of my girlfriends had the Paloma (also awesome), and another friend had the homemade Green Apple soda (a special for the night), which he loved.Okay, so now onto the food.Ohhhh, the food.Blue Lake Green Beans. Every person at the table said the same thing (both times): \"how can you make green beans taste THIS good?\" Answer from David: the woodfire grill, of course. Apparently in the winter there are brussel sprouts instead of green beans, so I can't wait for it to get chilly again!Things I didn't eat but was told were amazing: the chicken and waffles and \u00a0pork belly steamed buns, pork ramen, chicken ramen, and chicken chow mein. All six of us last night were \"mmmm\"ing through the meal. Both times, I've ordered the vegetable chow mein with tofu. So. So. So good. The tofu is cooked on the woodfire grill, the vegetables (especially the mushrooms) are marinated in some blend of spices that are so delicious that one of my fellow diners had to try some out of another's bowl. For dessert... well, we went a bit dessert crazy. David let us know there were a few new desserts: a chocolate pudding with a cashew nougat and a citrus soft serve, in addition to the bananas foster fritters. It was my husband's birthday so we thought \"what the hell\" and ordered all three. And I am so glad we did, because they were all delicious. Throughout the meal David came by to ask us how everything was, to chit chat with us and make sure we knew he was available. We absolutely loved talking with him and appreciated so much that we knew he wasn't too busy for us (even though he was definitely busy!). I can't say enough good things about Clever Koi. Now I can't wait for the new menu to come out, so we have another excuse to go visit!"], ["Han H.", "It is kind of Japanese fusion food.

It does, however, serve really tasty Asian noodle and rice dishes, and I was pleasantly surprised to love my meal even though I usually am only a Thai and sushi fan when it comes to Asian eats.The hip spot has a patio overlooking Central Avenue, with the \"dings\" of the light rail creating the soundtrack to your dining experience if you choose to sit outside - which I love doing. Inside, an open kitchen and bar complements a bustling atmosphere with tables in cozy confines that make neighboring diners your friends.My pal and I took advantage of the $30 special, which came with a jug of spiked punch, a fruity concoction made with Japanese rice wine, pineapple juice and other fruit flavors. I could tell by my buzz it was strong, but you wouldn't be able to tell by the sweet flavor of the drink, which was refreshing and delicious.It was the perfect way to cool off the palate during my meal of vegetable chow mein, which was very filling with a ton of noodles and veggies. I loved the house-made sriracha sauce and also added soy sauce. I cleaned up my bowl, no problem. My only disappointment was I wasn't able to take advantage of the gluten-free noodles in my dish - our server said with the veggie chow mein, that wasn't an option.My pal got tofu fried rice, which he also enjoyed and ended up taking half of it home - his portion was also very generous, so I guess I was just hungrier. Our server said the tofu is marinated, which makes it extra flavorful, and my pal agreed.The staff was really friendly, but it was a bummer it took about 10 minutes to get hot sauce and soy sauce after our food was delivered. Other than that, the happening spot had an energizing atmosphere and made me like Asian food more than I ever thought I would."], ["Felipe M.", "I don't know why this place has only 4 stars!It's the real deal. Drinks were awesome! Prices reasonable. And food was \"WOW\" factor. Like literally every bite was great! Must taste for yourself."], ["Rachel R.", "So I'm trying to be a douche and park at George & Dragon, because I hate all things valet (it's complimentary, you just have to pay for it!)

You can't park there.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, you just assumed I'm going to Clever Koi?* Where do you get off, buddy?\"** But yeah, those sneaky buggers will totally corner you into valeting, tail betwixt legs.*I said literally none of this.**I silently complied. Moving on, it's happy hour. I order only full-priced drinks because I don't understand money. Fill Collins and Slippin' Jimmy are both exceptional, and I would've drank more if I didn't have to go to another thing to drink more after. The server, noticing our enthusiasm (and dashing good looks) recommended we sit at the bar and get creative with the bartender, which is 100% on for next time.Edible portion: - Highlight was also not an HH offering - chicken and waffles, featuring taco'd waffle filled with saucy chicken. \u00a0- Blood orange chicken wangs: sounds more creative than it is. Saltier than expected and served with ranch, you get three full bird arms in an artsy little stack. A great option for your friend who wishes you were at Pei Wei and a sports bar.- Yams o'brien: cubes of Japanese sweet potato with sriracha aoli, also much more normal than I had in mind. It's a fun and easy activity to mindlessly eat the whole bowl, but not essential. - Seasonal vegetable plate with steak: maybe I hate Spring, or vegetables, but the asparagus, beets, and kimchi didn't really do it for me. I liked the yams, but I'd already eaten like, 14 cups of yam by this point. I would pass on this in favor of several more chicken waffles next time. - Honorable mention: server candy! Man buns, septum piercings, gauges, and tattoos galore. The waiters were 104% more fun to look at than the guests.5 stars cocktailery & server candy, 3.5 star food.

In fairness, the lunch menu differs from the dinner menu, and I used some persuasion to get a taste of two of the items off the dinner menu. Having said that, I feel like my critique is not quite fair, since they did make these dishes while not technically available. I suppose if they could not execute them, they could have just refused my request. They did draw the line at these two dishes.Anyway, I thought the pig face dumplings were a great concept. I really dug the smoky flavor as it is something quite unique in terms of this type of dumpling.The pickled veggies and hot sauce were a nice touch to play off the smoky filling. Could have used a bit more crunch to the pickle. \u00a0The edges however were quite dry and brittle. Also sampled the duck bun. I found the bun to be a bit dry as well, the filling had a nice flavor if not a bit shy.From the lunch menu we sampled the crispy pork bahn mi. Nicely fried piece of pork, on what reminded me more of a pretzel bun than typical french baguette. The pickle served on this sandwich was quite limp and lacked flavor as well. The star for me this day was the hot and sour soup. Quite a nice balance of flavors and textures, and truly one of the better versions if not the best version I have had here in the valley. Washed it all down with a Lumberyard red ale. Quite a nice pairing with all of the smoky spicy situation going on. Smoky burps ftw!Cool space, service rocked.

The red curry broth really made this dish pop while the crunch of the nuts gave it texture. \u00a0The roast duck and potatoes just melted on your palates while the cilantro gave it a welcoming aroma! - Enjoy!The place itself had an Asian flare with a modern gastropub feel. \u00a0Nice to hangout for a quick bite or to check out their specialty drinks, which they have plenty! \u00a0Service can be spotty, but every waiter/waitress has their day! - Enjoy!"], ["Thao P.", "We ate outside. They have high fans outside that are quiet but keeps nice breezes coming along. It was very nice. Inside looked great, too. Very streamlined with tasteful decorations. It was hard to pick what to eat. A lot of yelpers posted great pictures but they change the menu every few months so a lot of the pictures weren't being served. However they have a small menu so it's focused and makes your choice easier. We had the duck curry. It was pretty spicy but it's a nice thickened curry with big udon noodles. As I figured with most dishes here, it didn't have a lot of meat. You can probably see that in various dishes in the photos posted. The roasted potatoes in there were great. We had the tea-a-misu which I didn't care for. The texture was off. I wanted to try the steamed bun sandwiches but I couldn't justify the price for just one.

The Caesar Salad is a delicate symphony of classic infused with the most delicate of Asian Flavors and even though I only had a small bite of it I thought it was delightful. I was expecting the Szechuan Crouton to be something special either spicy or full of flavor but it was just a hard lump of something I couldn't determine.The Roast Corn Dumplings were another one of the very goods. The dumplings were tender and dressed with finely cut scallions. The Tomato Broth was multi-dimential with changing flavors of sofrito, ginger and Thai Basil with a building but not too hot heat.I thought both appetizers were very good and will forget about the Szechuan Croutons.I had the Salmon Bibimpap. I do note I am more sensitive than most people about smoke flavor and some smoke flavors are hard for me to tolerate. My first bite of the salmon was delicious with a charcoal kind of flavor that I enjoy but most of the salmon had a strong smoke flavor that took over. My vegetables were fresh and they gave me lots of brown rice. I didn't really taste any Korean Chili Glaze in my dish so I don't know if it had any or not. People who don't mind a smokey taste will like this dish.My husband had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken. He was a little disappointed because the chicken was very soft and in his words \"squishy\" He was also disappointed because the spice and flavor level was \"Old White People from Sun City\".I thought the Tea-a-misu was exactly the way it was described on the menu.The Roasted Peach Fritters were really Donuts with a little bit of Peach in them. They were made fresh to order and were tasty with the Cream Cheese Dip.Service was friendly but a little odd. My husband expressed his opinions to the management about the food.

I came here with my family, a party of 5. We ordered everything on the happy hour food menu to share (5 dishes, minus the wood grilled veggies). The pork ramen was so good, we ordered 2! We all were fighting for the last bit. We added a kimchi fried rice with pork belly which was so good, I want to try it again with the other proteins. From rave reviews, we ordered each steamed bun (5) for each one of us and WOW! Just wow. So full of flavor like all the other dishes. And the greatest part, is that all of these dishes plus 3-4 drink orders came out to exactly $100. I was expecting much more!

The steak in the bibimbap had perfectly crispy edges and tender on the inside. The hotpot is to die for. I don't usually care for thick noodles, but these soak up so much flavor. My boyfriend also does not care for catfish-- except what was in this hot pot. Definitely squeeze some lime into it (comes on the side).Those cocktails-- amazing. I had the Pimm Jong Il and boyfriend got a tasty canned beer from Nebraska. We also had the drink with sriracha-something in it. You've gotta try it, it's light but with an edge. Also made by a well-dressed man.What I really admired was the co-owner working the kitchen (we sat at the bar, where there's an open kitchen).

There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness.

It was arranged in a way that looked very appetizing. The veggies were very fresh. The crab Rangoons were impressive and had a spicy kick to them. Loved it! Good eggrolls! They even cut a hole in the top of the box so the Rangoons and Rolls didn't get soggy from the steam (since they're fried) I feel as if I've gotten lucky. There is a badass asian food restaurant near my house and they deliver! Can't beat that!"], ["Rob E.", "Looks a little sketchy from outside but nice little place. Really good prices! We tried the veggie spring rolls, hot and sour soup (like 4 bowls in the reg size order), garlic noodles, and basil fried rice. Everything was really good. Fried rice was very spicy!

But Seriously. This place is on my list of top favorite restaurants. Not only is the food freshly made and just ridiculously delicious.It's also cheap! The first time I went here, my boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers, two entrees, and three drinks, and the total still came out to approximately $30 (not including tip). \u00a0Whereas other places would have charged us at least $40, for the the same quality of food.They also practice wonderful customer service, and they're friendly. So that's always a plus as well!"], ["Jane H.", "Absolutely delicious Thai food offered by a pleasant server. \u00a0Ordered green curry with extra veggies and tofu and it was so yummy I ate the rest for dinner.

We live pretty close to this place, and have eaten here, easily, 30+ times over the past two years... possibly 40+. Not one time have we been less than happy as clams. The woman who runs the front (phone and restaurant... it's pretty impressive) always remembers us, is always nice and courteous, and super helpful. My favorites: - Thai Basil Beef with extra beef and medium spice. This is a dinner, a lunch and a midnight snack, easily. So, so much food, even without rice. I love that I can order as spicy (or not) as I want. When we followed paleo, this was my takeout go-to, and still is today. - Egg drop soup. It is so yummy! No weird stuff going on, either; fresh veggies and super-tasty broth, served piping hot. This is a great value, at $2.95 for a large. This easily serves four people as an appetizer... orrrr one really, really hungry person who is craving some comfort food. - Sweet & sour chicken. This is not your average S&S ck. The meat is completely identifiable and the breading is light enough to not weigh down the whole dish. Good sauce, too. - No longer on the menu, but the Thai roll with peanut sauce. I really wish they would bring sexy back. - BBQ pork fried rice, extra pork. Um. Yeah. Extra pork, because pork. Duh. This is a massive serving, too. - Online ordering. - The kid menu has pretty large servings, too. - Clean. - Great service, even if there may be a wait. (There's a wait for damn good reason, so relax.) - It's been a while since we have done it, but this place was BYOB. Suggest calling ahead to make sure this is still allowed. We quit bringing our own because beer just takes up room that is better filled with tasty, tasty food. My husband's list is undoubtedly even longer. We just love this place. Give it a try. DO IT!"], ["Britt C.", "After complaining to my friend about the lack of decent Thai restaurants in the valley, he had told me about Noodle & Rice. After visiting Thailand this past spring, I thought that Thai food was forever ruined for me in the states, as it would never be as good. Noodle & Rice comes really close to the flavors I experienced in Thailand. They have some of the best Panang Curry, it's creamy and delicious and they use authentic flavors that include kaffir lime, Thai chilies, and galangal. The portions sizes are huge for the price, and the service is always friendly and attentive. If you're looking for authentic Thai food, I highly recommend Noodle & Rice."], ["S.

I ordered it online and it said it'll be ready in 30 minutes.

Finally an hour later we got home to eat it and honestly I wasn't impressed. The yakisomi noodles were very dry, there were very little vegetables and the beef was not good. The drunken noodles were also dry and not very hot although we did order medium so that could've been our part but they were still dry. The dumplings were over fried and very dry as well.

On top of that there was plenty of cabbage and other roast pork floating around in there, carrots, scallions, the works. \u00a0I had to force myself to stop eating it so that I would have room for the rest of my meal.The egg roll was average. \u00a0It was definitely nice and crispy, but it was thin and it almost like eating just fried batter. \u00a0I can't really reduce my review because of one egg roll though.The hunan chicken was perfect. \u00a0The sauce was deliciously spicy and the whole dish was tasty. \u00a0The only thing I DIDNT like about it, was the amount of those bamboo shoots they put in it. \u00a0I would much rather have something crunchier like bok choy and/or water chestnuts but there were none in there. \u00a0I suppose I could have asked him to make it with them, but I'm not the type of person to ask for substitutes.Overall my experience there was excellent. \u00a0I was totally happy and satisfied when I left. \u00a0The decor is not bad. \u00a0It's not the Taj Mahal. \u00a0It just a local Chinese restaurant."], ["Lori W.", "I was in town -- will be moving there soon -- and looking for some good Chinese food.

The soup which consisted of noodles, chicken and broth was accompanied by very, very fresh basil, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, bean sprouts and lime. \u00a0Ample and fresh. \u00a0The soup broth, although it was chicken PHO, had a fishy backdrop taste. \u00a0Can't explain it but it was there. \u00a0Hubby gave it a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.Ordered the Walnut shrimp which was fried so much so that the batter had totally adhered to the shrimp. The crust outside the shrimp was much too thick. \u00a0The sauce was nothing more than mayonnaise. \u00a0The General Chicken which we had asked for extra spicy was not spicy at all. \u00a0When we told the waiter about it, he brought over some \"spicy oil\" to add to the dish to make it spicy. \u00a0Who wants to add oil to your food to make it spicy? Why not add chilies to the food while it is being saut\u00e9ed as other restaurants do? \u00a0When the orders came out, the server only brought out one brown rice and that we should share it until we \u00a0get another one later. \u00a0The order of brown rice was small enough to fit in the palm of my small hand and the rice was as hard as a rock. \u00a0My culinary savvy told me that the rice had been overly microwaved and that's why it harden so much so that it was inedible. Don't restaurants keep rice in rice cookers to keep it warm??? We showed the waiter to which he said he would bring another rice, but by then we had already finished eating. \u00a0I also told him \u00a0that I hoped that he wasn't charging us \u00a0for that rice. \u00a0He said he would go back and modify the bill. \u00a0I was stupefied that the reduction was not done immediately considering that I showed him that the rice could bounce off a wall. \u00a0The straws I requested at the beginning of our meal never arrived and napkins were in short supplyAll in all the meal was second rate and I apologize to my hubby for sending him on a wild goose chase 15 miles away from our home thinking we were going to have a lovely Saturday night meal. \u00a0And by the way... this is no East Coast type restaurant...

My soup was steaming hot when it got to our house, so that was great, but the rice didn't really sizzle....weird for sizzling rice soup. It should be noted that the soup broth was more of a wonton broth (as opposed to other places that have more of an egg drop broth base) and contained large vegetables (that were fresh and tasty and included celery, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, etc), different meats and shrimp. The soup was sort of layered indicating (to me) that they cook the meat and veg separately from the broth and add it in later. All of the shrimp was at the bottom, followed by pork and chicken (and green onions), with veg on top. This was fine and probably wouldn't be the case if you ate the food at the restaurant. Overall it was a solid bowl of soup, better than a lot of restaurants, but still nothing I would really think about later. The husband's sweet and sour chicken was on the bland side... not very sweet... and the chicken was the typical fried puff balls of unknown chicken parts... he though it was ok, and I didn't care for it.

Sure we may not have the options some bigger more culturally astute metropolis' offer, but we have a plethora of little spots like this, sequestered away in the seas of stripmalls that dominate the vast swathes of phoenix's urban sprawl. I came here on Xmas day with my brother, sister, mother and sister-in-law and I would say we were all pleasantly surprised. Little Peking is your standard American style Chinese fare, you'll see all the usual suspects; almond chicken, kung pao, lo mein, moo goo gai pan, sweet and sour, twice cooked, well you get the picture. Despite the lack of \"authenticity\" (and I say that in quotes because who the hell am I, a white dude, to question whether or not a dish made by some one of Chinese descent is authentic) everything we ordered was darn good. Not overly greasy, the fried items being lightly breaded with only white meat used; I genuinely liked Little Peking's version of twice cooked chicken more than the Chinese delivery place I regularly order from in my hood. Whats more is that their lunch menu was insanely cheap, we paid about $20 for a party of four. Little Peking is a solid option for those in the area, give them a shot."], ["Brianna S.", "My family has been dining at Little Peking for years. It's not much to look at - a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is delicious! Not to mention very well priced.

I had almond chicken which was as familiar as you can remember or imagine, one daughter had sweet-n-sour pork, which was a good balance of meat chunks and veggies/pineapple. \u00a0The other had House Special chicken, very crunchy and appetizing.We found the sweet/sour sauce VERY sweet, almost too sweet, but maybe that's because we don't use lots of sweet condiments(?). \u00a0Or maybe it was just prepared too sweet.Food was served nice and hot, and we all enjoyed it, even the one kid who was resistant to trying this new place. \u00a0We all agree that we will be back for more. \u00a0Prices are great- about $6 each for lunch which includes soup. wonton and eggroll as well as entree."], ["Grace K.", "I love this hole in the wall place!!!!!!!

Very tasty, nice big shrimp, for a lunch portion, and not to much oil used in the prep. Very good flavor. No upcharge for white meat in either of our meals.

The food took about 20-25 minutes once my order was placed. Prices were okay, but the food wasn't anything to write home about.

The decor reminds me of family restaurants that were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It's definitely outdated, yet comfortable and appropriate for families, at the same time. The service was quick and as friendly as it could be considering the language barrier. The lunch plates are filled with more than ample portions and include an egg drop soup appetizer and fried won tons. My friend's vegetable plate was good and my house chicken special was moist and flavorful. We both enjoyed the rice but the egg rolls had an odd tasting spice that neither of us could identify. The price was right, for sure! \u00a0Lunch for two was just under $12 (plus tax and tip.) \u00a0I will definitely consider visiting Little Peking again in the future. I love that it's a locally owned business and my dollars are going to help support a local family."], ["GrayArea S.", "Exceptional Chinese restaurant because they will listen, accomodate and remember your needs. I've seen them serve Spicy dishes with no spice, take sugar and salt out of their dishes, remove and substitute vegetables, change sauces, and more to accomodate various people I have brought here. Superb Wor Wonton and Hot & Sour soup, also highly recommend the Mongolian Beef, Sauteed Three Seas, Moo Shu whatever, Bell Pepper Steak and any Lo Mein."], ["Christina L.", "This place used to be one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived in the area. Last night, a friend and I decided to revisit Little Peking for dinner. Unfortunately, it might have been an off night. The garlic chicken was lackluster (and a bit chewy) and her shrimp in lobster sauce was overcooked. The Wonton Soup is all of the wonton ingredients dumped into broth, rather than the delightful packets of fun I've come to expect when I order this.

I may be a little bias because I've been coming here for almost 9 years, it's right next to my barbershop as well. The sun devil chicken is my favorite dish hands down. I love spicy!

I'm also a huge fan of the Mongolian beef, but you really can't go wrong with any dish at this place. Sometimes it's nice to go in and grab a table or sit at the bar. Very quiet nice atmosphere.

I'm guessing the 99 cent draft beers are the main attraction of this place. It seems like the bar was the only thing with a crowd of people. Walking in I was confused was I supposed to seat myself or what? There didn't seem to be much organization with this place. The guy at the sushi bar took my order since I sat there, but another guy gave me my plate and utensils. They forgot to bring out the miso soup included in my meal, and when I asked about it later the bowl they brought out was lukewarm and not very tasty. It had seaweed and tofu, but no flavor and a strange consistency. The ginger included with the sushi had a strange taste to me. I eat a lot of sushi, and this ginger was the artificially pink kind (which usually means mass produced). It had a strange taste which I could only associate with cheap alcohol. I understood why some of my friends don't like ginger if this is the stuff you try your first time. The chirashi bowl I got was sort of small, but acceptable for the price. The one thing that makes me never want to come back is on the back of a piece of albacore the fish was turning GREEN... Now I've never seen anyone present a piece of fish to me that was already turning green. \u00a0I can't understand how as a chef you could miss that before putting it on the plate. Then have the audacity to hide it by putting that side facing the other way. I worry about what about the other pieces that I didn't turn around (that piece was probably on the end). Even more, the guy taking away my plate didn't notice that I had otherwise finished my plate but left that single green piece there for him to see. Doesn't that seem a little strange that someone would finish their meal but leave a single untouched piece of fish on a plate separate from what it was presented on?

I have some dietary restrictions of no dairy and no meat other than fish and eggs. They were very accommodating and even custom built a dish for me. The food quality is really good and everything was fresh. I have tried the curry shrimp(normally chicken), Pad Thai with tofu and vegetables, the California roll, and tasted about 5 other rolls. The curry shrimp was a yellow curry and was portioned perfectly. Delicious!On our most recent visit one of my friends did their sushi challenge which consists of eating a roll covered in a ghost chili sauce. It was a lot of fun and made the dining experience even more sociable."], ["Vi M.", "I don't know where the negative reviews are coming from, but this place is great.

So he makes us the Caterpillar roll, which was outstanding and then he prepared the insanely spicy roll for me. I finished it in under two minutes, (I dare you to try and beat that!), and my goodness, it was spicier than anything I have ever eaten, but it was more than just spicy because it had great flavor to it as well!

The guy who took my order was a little bit grumpy but he wasn't THAT rude for me to walk out. Once the food was ready, he came outside to get me to let me know, which i thought was pretty kind of him. Now let me begin on the food.......

I am not a fan of tufu, but this one was really good and the sauce made a good combination. She also ordered an eggplant, i forgot which one it was but it was eggplants in a semi sweet sauce, she had no complains on this either. I was very pleased with the food, the portion size, and the price.

Went here because I was told they had Dim Sum and I was in the mood. So to start the place was about half full so maybe that's considered busy to them. We were immediately seated in a booth but that's where the service ended. The first food cart came by and the waitress or server pushing it was immediately demanding and pushy that we just pick and not look. Personally I was just waiting for someone to ask what I wanted to drink. So after making some selections I realize the food had hair on it so I showed her and she took at. The issue is she didn't adjust our ticket and I had to tell her. Instead of her removing it from the ticket she said she would find more food to replace it. My stomach was not feeling that I wanted more food but I let it go. So three more carts come by and we get food items. Each time I'm asking for sriracha \u00a0or sweet and sour sauce and each time they tell me to ask my waiter. Wish I knew who that was because no one has showed and I still haven't gotten a drink. Finally I grab someone running by and they bring us some water. Still no sauces. In fact one girl I grab has no clue what sriracha even is. Finally someone brings some hot sauce and some other sweet and sour. At this point I get a work call on the cell so I walk out the door to take the call. Luckily my work date paid for the food and took it to go or I probably wouldn't have gone back in.End of story, do not go to this place under any circumstance. Horrible service won't even let you get to the point if the food is any good. First and last visit in one."], ["Randy B.", "Haha.

Waters are never refilled after the first time, the plates and dim sum holders are nasty. They need to wash their dishes better. I am not Chinese, so it's hard to communicate with the ladies their who doesn't really speak English. (Not trying to be rude). But not everyone who comes here are Chinese so it is very hard to talk with the workers here sometimes. The cashier lady is just a no no. She is always asking for tips.

Went for dimsum one Saturday at 12:30pm and the restaurant was packed. After we were seated, we chose the fried squid, fried shrimp with sugar cane, and sticky rice from the dimsum cart. They were stone cold and hard. The manager's response was \"it is dimsum; it goes around the room.\" It only told me that the turnover was not high on certain foods and yet they chose to prepare them anyway and serve them after they are past acceptable. I have had dimsum in other cities and have NEVER had cold food that was supposed to be hot, dimsum cart or not. Just to be fair, the siomai, gai lan and jellyfish were okay. They were tasty and were the acceptable temperature for food going around a large room in a cart. That's the one star you earned. The noodles? It would have been nice if you added a few vegetables aside from the onions.As for the service, it was fine. Our server was a sweet older lady who was very helpful and attentive.

Nonetheless, the meal was good, crisp duck skin, good sauce but the soup was mediocre at most. Just remember, it's family style here.If you come here, you should be for their Dim Sum! They get pretty crowded, but it's worth it. I always get the basics when it comes to Dim Sum so I get the Ha Cao, Siu Mai, BBQ Pork Buns, Soft Tofu dessert, shrimp noodle. I got the chinese broccoli to try last time, but the oyster sauce was way too salty- so pass on that one. Other than that there's not much to it, just point to something or ask for what it is.

Also, the walnut shrimp, that is extra heavy on mayo, and well..... I could eat that for days. They also have good tea.

The sometimes long waits and groups of people gathered outside waiting anxiously to be called is a testament to the quality and authenticity of the restaurant.

One time when we went during the summer, it was incredibly hot, and we all drank our waters incredibly quickly, and the service was so bad that servers never came by again to give us anymore. After a while, it feels like carts avoided us and we were not sure if we made sort of faux pas. Just don't expect great service. The food is generally worth it though.

If they don't have anymore then why don't they make it?! It was only 1pm and dim sum ends at 3pm. I also asked for turnip cake and they said there's no more too. I came hungry and left hungry. Their BBQ pork buns were barely filled with any pork. What a disappointing experience. Since I've moved to the west side of Arizona, this is the only place nearby.

The best items, in my opinion, were the fresh wide noodles with the meat inside, the bok choy, the shu mai, the pork bao and the custard dessert. The bok choy was especially delicious, saut\u00e9ed in some savory sauce, yet still a little crunchy. The rest of the food was highly fishy and not so awesome.

The second time reveals a disturbing issue. Well this is absolutely disappointing to write. Especially after writing a favorable review of Great Wall the first time around. But our experience here was not good during our last visit.First, we were not acknowledged when we came in the door. We had to pardon an employee (who appeared to be doing nothing) to take us in. He then proceeded to take us to a booth after we requested a table and chairs. We asked again to be seated at a table and chairs and he finally obliged. We were given menus and that's when the real trouble began in terms of service. First, we ordered a lot of food. 2 main dishes, 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an extra side dish to split. It was my last night in Phoenix so I wanted to go all out and sample some different things. Besides, we have the money so who cares right? Well, the drinks came and when we ordered the server let us know there were no BBQ pork ribs, but didn't offer an alternative. When I picked something else, he rolled his eyes and said \"So you really want pork?\". Yes. I do. So we waited for our appetizers, only one of which came out before the main dishes. The others came out with the dinners. Now the food was good, I have no complaints there. But when the person bringing us the food came out, she would't even look at us. The feeling I was getting was that they were either disgusted with our presence or just didn't care to talk to their non-Asian customers. I say that because the servers were \"chatting up\" the Chinese folks at their tables (it wasn't a busy night only a few small families), but they were literally ignoring us and a hispanic family sitting adjacent to us. I wouldn't normally write about that but it was so egregious I have to say how it appeared to look. I wish I could say it had something to do with language barriers and being comfortable with your native tongue maybe, but they spoke English fine from what I saw and it just didn't feel good to be ignored. Anyway, no refills on tea, water, or our main drinks were given. When we were done, we were ignored for 20 minutes until I glared at another server who was having banter with an Asian couple near us. I guess he told our server to bring us a check. So we pull out the Amex and what do you know? For the first time all night our server immediately comes over and says in perfect English \"we don't take American Express\" (even though the tray the bill was on says \"Amex Preferred\", but that's neither here nor there.Wow. Once it was time to pay, he's on my shoulder like a parrot. Prior to that, he wanted nothing to do with us. Finally, the woman who came out to put the food in 'to-go' bags literally ignored us even after I smiled and tried to talk to her. She turned her head away when my date tried to thank her for putting everything in bags for us. And our sending off? Waiting another 10 minutes for someone to come take the card before giving up and walking to front and giving the bill to someone who appeared to be a manager. No tip given. You've got to be kidding me. In the end this experience wrecked what was supposed to be my new Chinese food place. The service ruined what was great food. The feeling I got while there was that they didn't particularly care if we (non-Chinese customers) were there. And that is really sad.

It was an Asian wedding and some of the food that came out for the guests included soup, seafood, fried rice, and dessert. Coming here for lunch is much different. It is not as busy as a wedding would be of course and mostly you see big groups there such as a family. Every entree is family style so we basically all just ordered and shared the food within our party. Food is always delicious and tasty there.

It was my first time here for dim sum, but I heard great things about Great Wall. As we drove into the parking lot it was already full. The wait was maybe about 20-30 minutes for us and looking inside it was pretty packed. So, I thought wow, maybe this place is all the hype. Once we got seated we got shumai (I think that's how you spell it). It's a pork dumpling. We also ordered chicken wings, shrimp dumplings, chow mein noodles, and chicken feet! I know a lot of people that may be unappealing, but the chicken feet was very good. I loved it! Overall, I can always recommend this place because I basically enjoy the food they have here. I would say when I had the best tasting of \u00a0food was during the time I came here for a wedding. The next best is during the time they serve dim sum, but as stated above it does get busy so coming here early would be the best thing if you do not want to wait. Staff was good, but we did keep seeing the same person with the same cart of food like 5 times. It sucks that its a pretty far drive for me to get here or else I'd be over here all the time for dim sum. So, on that note I will definitely be back here again for dim sum and if you NEVER tried or experience it, mine as well get to Great Wall and try it!"], ["Diana H.", "For dim sum in the north valley of Phoenix, it's the best we have! \u00a0Get there early - we were seated (party of 7) immediately at 1020am on a Sunday. \u00a0Shortly thereafter, the wait was very long. \u00a0Dim sum is very good - some dishes hot and some warm.."], ["Joyce W.", "Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple. \u00a0I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was \u00a0kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born! \u00a0 It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food. \u00a0As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day. \u00a0They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner. \u00a0If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD! \u00a0Chinese people are loud. \u00a0We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices. \u00a0I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant. \u00a0;)Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of \u00a0majestic China. \u00a0*wistful sigh*Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart. \u00a0From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music. \u00a0Cheers!"], ["Chris H.", "Fantastic authentic place for Dim Sum. The prices are reasonable and the food fresh. Lots of choices and they have a standard menu.Theses one of those places thats tucked away in a shopping plaza that looks slightly questionable, but you know the food will be good. Everything checked out good as I looked around and it seemed like I was one of the only non-Asian persons there, which is a very good sign that I am in the right place! When they have live fish tanks in the back where you can pick or buy your seafood you know its the real deal!Service was a bit slow, but they were fairly busy when I was there for lunch, overall everything was good.I would go back again next time I get the Dim Sum craving."], ["Dwayne O.", "Have been here mainly for large celebrations such as wedding receptions, Chinese baby red egg, funeral memorial meal and Chinese New years. So we have never eaten here ala carte. When you eat there for a large celebration it is generally between a 8 to 10 course meal. When eating this way you eat \"family\" style so you get to try multiple dishes and get a little of each dish and then spin the dishes around on a lazy Susan to share with the others at your table. The servers were okay but the restaurant itself is good when they have a banquet style.Nothing to bring you back because of the decor or service, would probably only come here for the banquet."], ["Mary N.", "The food was decent, but I just didn't like how packed it was for dim sum. It would be nice if the cart came into our section often. So we didn't get much food and variety."], ["Saul S.", "Having toured Hong Kong and China are times and moving from New York this is the only place I have found in the Phoenix area that holds a candle to the authentic flavored you would get over seas. Must tries are the roast suckling pig, Peking duck, any of the dim sum is superb, and the noodle dishes are always fantastic. Also having live prawns, crabs and geoduck is a real treat I. The dessert"], ["Bob D.", "Poor quality Dim Sum. You will get slightly better at C-Fu Gormet or Phoenix Palace in Chandler (both at Warner and Dobson). That said, none of these restaurants compares to the quality of many large city Dim Sum restaurants like Yang Sing in San Francisco. The Great Wall clams would be much better without the horribly bitter sauce dripped over them. And someone needs to teach them how to make sesame balls which should have a sweet yellow bean pur\u00e9e without a bitter after taste. We had several other dishes -- none up to par.This was our third and last visit."]], "Maxim Restaurant": []}
