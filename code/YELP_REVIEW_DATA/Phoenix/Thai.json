The food: excellent, hot, and well-spiced (well, except the vegetable rolls). \u00a0The spring vegetable rolls were crisp and tasty, along with some delicious peanut sauce. \u00a0I had a history of these with friends who made them homemade in the 1990s, and these were a close recipe! I ordered a vegetable stir-fry. The waitress said I could specify vegetables to be removed from the dish. \u00a0They were out of sticky rice (sadness) but I love jasmine rice.

I had to ask for more rice in which my server had no problems bringing me some. The pad se ew tasted sweet. I usually like mine hot, tangy and spicy.Overall, I would definitely come back!

Stopped in for dinner one night. There's lots of parking right behind the building, so don't stress yourself in the tiny lot out front.Restaurant is small, cute, and the staff are super nice. Started out with the chicken satay, which was good. Flavor was nice, chicken was juicy, and the peanut sauce was fine. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding.Entrees were pad thai with chicken and red curry with tofu. I thought the pad thai was a bit too sweet, and it almost had a touch of ketchup flavor. I'm not sure how it was seasoned, but it wasn't my favorite pad thai. Red curry was fine - again, nothing extraordinary.If I wanted a quick bite, I wouldn't mind stopping in.

We called to see if they did delivery and were informed that the delivery guy had left for the day already. It wasn't a huge deal because the place is so close, so I biked to pick it up. They said it would be ready to go in around 15-20 min. First thing that made me nervous when I got there was I didn't see a bike rack, sign, pole, anything to lock my bike to, so I had to leave it sitting right outside the store for the world to walk off with. Otherwise, the place looked nice and clean, the lady had my order ready and was polite and quick with processing my payment. After I got home I was excited to see the food. I had ordered Chicken Spicy Noodles \u00a0(med. spicy) with an added side of sticky rice and my sis had ordered Pad Thai Chicken.Both main dishes looked delicious (a little sloshed due to the ride back) but delicious. The only 'ugh' thing was the side of sticky rice, it looked horrible. It was packaged in a little fold over sandwich bag and seemed very stiff. ((I'm not the best cook but the only time my sticky rice looked like that was when I had overcooked or reheated it wrong)). Once I took it out of the bag I feared the rice was a lost cause, I had to pry a chunk off just to try. Needless to say I was hoping that it tasted better but I was wrong there too. I ended up tossing it.The flavors of the main dishes made the loss of rice bearable. My dish was extremely good and had a very delicious heat, my sis's dish was also very tasty with a nice crunch. I would say this is definitely a good place to stop if you're nearby and craving Thai. The prices were decent and I will most likely eat here again when I've got a craving and not wanting to go out; though I doubt I'll ever get the sticky rice again - better just make my own."], ["Youri L.", "Just discovered this Thai place after driving by it with a friend.

I was so excited to try it! Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to the glowing reviews. The space is nice, very quiet and relaxing, and the service was attentive. I ordered the spicy noodles and my friend had the pad see ew. Although both dishes seemed fresh, with fresh veggies and juicy chicken, the flavor was lacking. Hers was almost completely flavorless. Mine, ordered 'hot' was also fairly bland... more of a medium spicy and lacking seasoning. I would like to and probably will try this place again, as it is close to my house, and hope that other items (such as curries and soups) are more flavorful."], ["Kelly M.", "This thai place was just okay. Nothing special. I considered leaving only two stars for this restaurant because the food was very overpriced and it was literally the most uneventful dining experience I have ever had. But I decided to be generous because the food was not terrible and the restaurant had a nice, clean interior. The main things that irked me about this place were the prices and the fact that they don't offer cups of soup, only bowls. I absolutely adore tom-yum soup, and enjoy starting my meal off with a cup, but this place only offers $10 bowls of soup. When I asked the waitress about this, she told me it was no big deal and that I should just order my entree and a bowl of soup... uh, me thinks not. Really, how hard is it to offer a cup of soup?

I work nearby so we go at lunch time. They have a great lunch menu, great price, but it's dead. The staff is really good at holding up the bar with their bodies. Basically leaning on it all day. It's rare to get a smile out of them, it's more of a \"ugh, how many? sit here.\" and a dead pan face.I don't know if they inject sleeping pills in the water or what, but getting some sort of energy out of any of the servers would be a feat. It's also going to take the entire hour lunch, because of the staff. The food comes out quickly, there's no issue in the kitchen.

The restaurant was relatively empty with only few customers. I ordered chicken pad thai and the meal did not resemble typical pad thai I usually got from other thai restaurants. It was watery and disgusting. On top of that the chicken was not thoroughly cooked and I have the proof (PICTURE). I told the server that I can't eat this because the chicken was not cooked. He then asked if I wanted to order something else and I decided to have the same meal my husband ordered beef basil. I made a bad choice, I should have sampled prior ordering! The meal was as bad as the chicken pad thai. It was salty and beef was hard to chew on. \u00a0I was utterly disappointed. I do not blame the workers but I blame the management. They do not provide enough training for the cook to ensure food quality and SAFETY are properly maintained (HELLO UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN). What really irritates me the most I was charged for UNDERCOOKED chicken pad thai (my husband should have reviewed the bill before make a payment). I disputed the bill which then the server refunded our money and made us make another payment with the correct check.The server did apologize but I did not feel like it was a genuine apology. \u00a0There were tons of 'hiccups' and 'surprises' dining in this place. \u00a0Servers are the nerve center of the business and they should be more attentive to customers' needs, be more observant and deliver a genuine care.

I like the place, it's got a good vibe and my beef stir fry was good but nothing to write home about. I suppose by Arizona standards, where crap ethnic food is the norm, Red Thai manages to stand out as one of the better options for Asian cuisine in the area. But if you come from L.A., San Fran, New York, etc. you're bound to be disappointed as you've been by many other Asian establishments in The Valley. I REALLY like the bar. It is the stand out feature of the place and I think it's a shame that they close so early because I think they could do a decent business later at night with the bar crowd. I know it's a little isolated but other than North Central Sports Bar, there really is no other place nearby to catch a drink and I think these guys are missing out but not staying open later.I would certainly be open to coming in again.

Out of this world delicious. The Silver Noodle and Tom Kha are spectacular. Deeply flavorful. Hands down some of the best soups I've had in a long time. Clearly I can't recommend Reign of Thai's soups more. On to the noodles. The Pad Thai is always a good point of comparison, and sadly, Reign of Thai's Pad Thai was a major swing and a miss. It was waaaay too sweet, lacked any kind of complex flavor, and even my kid said it was gross and wouldn't eat it. Yuck. The Pad See Ew was ok, but nothing special. It was edible, at least. Larb is one of our very favorite dishes and sadly, this white girl makes a far better larb in her own kitchen. It majorly lacked one of the signature flavors of larb: toasted rice powder. It's like they skimped on it. Not cool. They also really skimped on the service. Awful. Just awful. Aside from actually carrying our dishes to our table, there was literally no service. He never checked on us which made it difficult to ask where our missing dish was. It also left us very thirsty.All in all, Reign of Thai offered a good soup experience and I'd come back for those.

All good, according to the party. Would definitely return but maybe choose spice levels one step down.
