Staff was very friendly and my order was made upon ordering and it was served hot and fresh. Tiny place but clean and welcoming! A little bit pricey tho!"], ["Drew K.", "This is my first review here on yelp, i've been really hesitant to leave reviews because i can tend to be critical but i have to set record straight here after seeing all these positive high ratings on this place.I live in the neighborhood and am a sucker for local business owners and love to contribute to everything local but i've been here twice wanting to like this place cuz its so close to me but i was sadly disappointed. \u00a0My first visit i got the gyro which should be the staple of any greek joint and the avgolemono soup. \u00a0First the gyro, i'm not sure if i'm just used to portions at gyro spots on the east coast but what i got here was a joke..... Everything was all chopped up and mixed together??? And very small amount of meat. I'm typically used to getting gyros with nice big shavings spilling out of the pita..... Here you could take the whole pita and practically envelope the contents..... 4 big bites max and you are done. For the price, no fries just gyro its super weak. \u00a0Next the soup...... Rice not cooked, barely any chicken not worth the time, again poor execution.Second visit/chance i had people in town from back east itching for a greek salad, for some reason i came back..... I guess i wanted to give a local business a 2nd chance to impress. \u00a0So i went for the greek salad thinking how can you mess that up right?? Well guess what the salad was more pitiful then the gyro..... First issue.... Who charges $8 for a salad and uses mostly iceburg lettuce!! Strike one, next there was shredded carrots in it, probaby from the pre-pak iceburg salad mix?? Strike two....... Lastly they put one chinsy little salad dressing in for the salad! What a joke. \u00a0Others had ordered soup despite my warning, i tried that again..... Very inconsistent to the soup i had, even less chicken.Overall pricey for what you get, won't be back.... You can catch me being happy going a little farther for the guy up the street."], ["Michael R.", "Okay, so it's only been a few weeks since they opened, but I had heard about them through an associate, and he said they were clearly better than their local competition. \u00a0I ate there yesterday and I think I'll go back at some point, but I'm still not convinced on a few points.11:30am, two guys working. \u00a0One taking orders and doubling as grill assistant. \u00a0The other was, I'm assuming, the owner, who was on the grill. I only ordered a Chicken Souvlaki Pita and the appetizer Hummus and Pita, so I qualify my review by saying I do need to try more of a sampling of their menu. \u00a0When I do, I'll update my review.Order taker was friendly and efficient, and greeted me with a smile. \u00a0He took my simple order and I told him it was \"to go\". \u00a0He acknowledged.********************************PROS: \u00a0Hummus was chunky, not smooth, which is how I prefer it. \u00a0I like chunky hummus, but that's just my preference. \u00a0I'm going to guess it was made in-house. \u00a0I could taste the tahini (sesame paste) and I'm pleased with that. \u00a0Hummus without tahini is hardly hummus at all, and is just sad.Pita triangles were adequate in number for the size of the appetizer (I didn't run out) and they were soft and tasted freshly warmed. \u00a0Olive oil on top and two kalamata olives completed the presentation.Chicken Souvlaki Pita had some of the best tasting Greek chicken I've ever had. \u00a0Grilled to perfection, with large, juicy, well-seasoned (marinated) chunks of breast meat. \u00a0Very good flavor!Tzatziki was plentiful.Lettuce, tomatoes, etc., were fresh and tasted fine.**********************************CONS: \u00a0Waited a long time for my 'to go' order. \u00a0That is not a big deal, especially if they are cooking the food hot and fresh, which was the case. \u00a0Grill person apologized for the long wait.While I was waiting, the order guy brought out the hummus appetizer I ordered and put it down in front of me on a plate. \u00a0When I politely reminded him it was a \"to go\" order, he said something about \"I thought you wanted the hummus here, and the chicken pita for take-out.\" \u00a0No. \u00a0When I ordered, I said I wanted it \"to go\". \u00a0Hmmmmm.So he took it back and gave it to me in a 'to go' container, resting on a paper sandwich wrap, when my sandwich was ready.Order taker also handles food when he's not taking an order. \u00a099% of the time, he washes his hands before handling the food. \u00a0Not 100%, but I have to give it to him... he's almost there, and I appreciate that greatly!Hummus was just okay, flavor-wise. \u00a0I tasted the tahini, which is good, but it was pretty bland after that. \u00a0Maybe that's their style, but a little roasted garlic, lemon juice, a dash of cayenne and a kicked up olive oil would make it better. \u00a0That's just my opinion. \u00a0Pita is adequate, but wasn't anything I couldn't get from a supermarket. \u00a0I think an olive oil brush and some more time on the hot grill would help a lot. \u00a0Give me slightly charred, toasty pita bread that is still soft in the middle and you've got me.The Chicken Souvlaki Pita had great-tasting chicken (as I mentioned), but my last bite had a huge, honkin' piece of GRISTLE in it. \u00a0It ruined the sandwich for me. \u00a0(I'm a home cook, and I've trimmed thousands of chicken breasts. \u00a0When you've trimmed your first 50, you pretty much know where 99.99% of the gristle is. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0I'm assuming they prep and trim their own chicken in the restaurant, so there's really no excuse for that. \u00a0It's a deal killer for me.)The tzatziki was plentiful, but runny, not thick. \u00a0It was hard to call it flavorful when it was so thin. \u00a0I'm guessing if it was thicker, the flavor of the cucumber, garlic and olive oil would come through better and give it a creamier, more luscious feel. \u00a0They're very, very close, in my opinion.PRICE: \u00a0I think their prices are on the high end, comparatively. \u00a0My Chicken Souvlaki Pita was $6.25 with no 'sides' (\"make it a combo for only $2.95 more\", for a total of $9.20), and the appetizer Hummus & Pita runs $4.50. \u00a0My bill was $10.75, before tax. \u00a0Not ridiculous for fresh, hot food, but more than other places I like.Under their \"Dinners\" menu, you will find plates starting at $11.95 and topping out at $13.50. \u00a0THEN, below the heading \"Dinners\" you read, \"add crumbled feta for $1.50\". \u00a0What? \u00a0A Greek dinner costing between $11.50 and $13.50 has an up-charge of $1.50 for crumbled feta? \u00a0Seriously?Like I said, I will most-likely try them again, and try a wider range of options on their menu. \u00a0I think I'll give them a bit more time to trim off the rough edges (and the gristle, hopefully!) before I visit a second time.\"A\" for effort.\"C-\" for execution."], ["Hailey B.", "Holy Greek salad goodness, Spartan knows how to make a MEAN Greek salad!

The 300 is a nice sized burger topped w/ gryos meat, feta, red onions and tzaziki, great idea and great mix of flavors. Hitipit is a dip made of feta and peppers- not super spicy but enough heat to bring real flavor. You don't see Htipit on menus too often, I think Spartan may be the only place in the Valley with it.

It had maybe three pieces of lamb, and lots of vegetables. The vegetables were fresh, but there were too many conflicting flavors going on. My tongue was very confused by the whole experience. It was the gastronomic equivalent of one of those big-budget 3D movies that have no plot. I probably would have enjoyed my meal better had it been in plate form, as I originally ordered. So I might give this place another shot.I did not like the falafel at all, nor the garlic tahina sauce that came with it. I thought it tasted bad. I like my falafel crispy outside and fluffy outside.

No diet is safe! \u00a0If you go with friends, split a side order of fries. You'll get a huge heap for only $2.My meat-eating friend is in love with their Caesar salad w/ grilled chicken. She says the chicken is amazing & seasoned to perfection. There are a decent number of tables inside, some Mediterranean decor, and TVs. They have self-serve fountain drinks as well as bottled water. There are Sriracha bottles scattered about for your spicy-dosing pleasure. They also have an outside covered patio with several tables. I love the patio during non-summer months.

I mean, it's a drive through!\" \u00a0To you, I have two things to say:1) For a place that has \"Pita\" in its very name. Z's kicks Pita Jungle's hippie little ass as far as delicious, pillowy, perfect little pitas go. Oh my god they are amazing, I could eat them all day.2) The drive through is actually Z's Greek's best asset, because the inside kind of reminds me a dumpy fast food place and the drive through makes it a convenient place to pick up food that isn't the complete garbage that comes out of most drive through windows.Actually, one of the hardest drives I ever have to make is the 2 mile drive from the end of the Z's Greek drive through to my condo. \u00a0The smell their delicious gyros infiltrates my car and makes it impossible to concentrate on anything other than GETTING THE EFF HOME TO GET THIS FOOD IN MY MOUTH. I'm an even bigger driving hazard than usual, putting my own life at risk in the name of pita, but it is totally worth it.I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki pita, stuffed with juicy marinated chicken and a side of tangy tzaziki (I add the sriracha myself), and a small Greek salad, loaded with enough feta cheese it's probably not even a healthy choice anymore. I also LOVE their avgolemono soup when it's not 1 million degrees (though I can't pronounce it and look like an idiot when I try). \u00a0I can usually get delicious, filling dinners for me and boyfriend and get out of there for less than $20, which makes it a great, inexpensive, healthy-ish option for nights when I don't feel like getting out of a damn car, letting alone cooking an entire dinner.So to answer your questions: Yes, you SHOULD try the questionable looking Greek place, yes, they ARE better than Pita Jungle, and yes, drive thru is always the way to go (unless they remodel their inside, which I would totally love, but I don't think it's quite made it to their business model roadmap.)

I'm a big guy and could really put away some groceries, but this was big. The chicken was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. The dressing and vegetables were a delicious part of this gargantuan mass of Greco-tastiness. The pita was soft, easy to chew and had a slight buttery taste. The ambiance was very casual with traditional Greek music playing, fitting to the bill of fair.

At $12, it seemed pretty reasonable.The plate came with rice, greek salad, baked small potatoes, a stack of pita bread all topped with a giant mound of gyro meat and two small containers of tzatziki. As we started engulfing down, we noticed how much food it was, even for 2 people. The mound of meat alone was a lot, but the carbo load (potatoes, rice, bread) definitely helped. The sauce was thicker than I'm used to, but it all had a good flavor. As we worked through our lunch (and didn't even finish it), we noticed that the group of ladies next to us had all gotten a platter- one each.

Perhaps it was an off night because our hummus was low on flavor. I expected the order of hummus to be a bit larger, it came in two medium taco cups.

But the interesting thing is, the old couple that sat next to us of course, stared at us, even though we weren't bringing any kind of attention to ourselves, and it was at my friend that the old man glared disapprovingly. Anyway, I digress. I've moved on from the hummus and gyros, and I'm kind of just obsessed with the saganaki. I love the pizzazz that the girls (or the boss) have when they pour the Bacardi on the feta and light it. It's quite a show if you'd like to impress your date.

I opted for the soup.The soup was incredibly bland and tasted mass produced. (I have been spoiled by Cypress Pita Grill - theirs is amazing!). The gyro was serviceable. Pita was fresh and tasty, the tzatziki was one of the best I have ever had. The meat? Well, it looked and tasted like gyro meat, and I was hungry - it did the job. Then Complicated pointed out that he once bought a case of gyro meat from Restaurant Depot. And hey - this is the exact same stuff! Looking closer - this was not sliced right of the rotisserie. Every piece was identical in thickness, length and width. And each had perfectly rounded corners. Bah! Why did he have to say that? Now I know Crazy Jim's uses prepackaged frozen gyro meat. Instead of prepackaged frozen gyro meat that's at least put on the rotisserie and sliced just for me. There shouldn't be a difference. But there is. And Jim's drops down on my list. I'll stick with Cypress Pita Grill or Athens Gyros when the cravings hit.Maybe I'll explore other items on the menu - I like the room - and I adore dining with Mr. It's Complicated - so I'll venture to other items and just stay away from the gyros from now on."], ["Sarah C.", "Super authentic Greek good..

Second impression: Crazy Jim's has the best pita I've ever tasted...I moved onto to my chicken feta salad with creamy greek dressing. Chicken = slightly charred, but not too dry, and totally delicious. Feta = abundant and high quality. And then, there's the creamy greek dressing... oh my zeus, it is amazing! Creamy and garlicky and completely drool-worthy. I now crave it frequently! Overall impression: This. Place. Rocks.We still order in to for the office every once in awhile, but I also frequent the restaurant on my own. I've dined in and ordered takeout, and every time, the food is more than satisfactory.

The salad was lacking a bit and could use pepperoncini, thinly sliced red onions, dryer feta, thin sliced green/red peppers.  I thought the pita was strange. It is nothing like any I tasted before and I've eaten at many Greek restaurants. It would have done them well to dress the gyro sandwich. It was terribly messy because of their strange bun-like pita, and only came with tzatziki and onions. I asked for the gyro to be extra crispy.

I had the Pasta Napoli last night and it was tasty, as were the spanikopitas and the garlic bread. Our hummus was very watery and chunky... would not order again. The people who run the place, and have ran it forever, are completely indifferent. They slam glasses and plates on your table, say \"what do you want?\" and tell you \"good customers get their own to go boxes.\" It's not that they are unfriendly, but they just have a different way about them. You're in the restaurant and they treat you as they would family or friends, rather than kissing your ass for being in their place. I like that charm a little bit.

A valley-local owned and operated spot for many years, the current owner George has personally greeted me on many occasions, and that is the not the least reason why I always come back. Fantastic bottled beer from several unique locations, amazing hummus combos for appetizers, and a gyro which truly deserves the name \"World Famous.\"Others have commented on how good the entrees are and I don't disagree. Everything is prepared carefully and served simply, this place is easy on the wallet and easy on the pants size due to healthy fresh ingredients.For starters, you cannot miss the Flaming Saganaki. With a traditional flair for showmanship, you'll hear either George the owner or one of his fantastic servers shout \"OPA!\" before setting fire to your appetizer. Dinner and a show!As mentioned, I have tried many other places searching for the \"Perfect\" gyro. While I don't truly believe that something can be 100% perfect, the World Famous from Saba's comes close. Piled up with fresh beef and lamb, filled with delicious veggies and just the right amount of tzatziki sauce, the real secret to this sandwich lies in the marinated gyro meat, which is cooked and shaved normally, but then cooked again in a special marinade sauce which makes this Gyro one of the juiciest and most satisfying you will ever have.Dessert is not to be missed either, simple items make a big impact here, with my personal fave being the ice cream and pita. They specially treat the pita for dessert with honey, powdered sugar, and upon request chocolate or raspberry sauce. With a dollop of delicious vanilla in the middle, you will be very satisfied by the simple pleasure. The baklava deserves an honorary mention as well.Everything on the menu is great, but more importantly, this restaurant provides an amazing family-dining feel that seems like you're stepping into George's living room.

The falafel itself was better than most falafel I've had locally, but it was either overcooked or cooked in very dirty oil because the outside was black (No, not dark brown... Black), and it tasted slightly burnt.The staff was friendly enough, but while I was waiting for my order, several of them \u00a0gathered near the front counter and had several personal conversations within earshot of me.

Owners, \"fine\" this is the nice way customer say \" nothing special\" . As we where asked the question, my wife mentioned that the Baba-ghanoush was sour just so the manager or owner that was taking our money would know and maybe go and check on the batch. What we got was excuse after excuse on why it was not maybe good, everything from we do not have a recipe \" we just taste it\" to there is a new guy working. At no point did she take it off the bill or look like she was going to do anything at all but take our money and tell us to have a nice day.

Most people can not taste the difference with Gyros, but I have to say they have the best Gyro meat. Their tzatziki sauce is probably one of my favorite things about the place. It just makes everything better! Their Chicken Pita sandwich is also always amazing. Their spices and ingredients are what makes their restaurant stand out.

She threw in ketchup packets and napkins into my to-go order bag and I was out the door in less than 10 minutes. The flat bread was very soft - in fact fell apart on me as I tried to eat it taco-style - and the fries were tasty if a bit boring (the seasoning is just paprika and salt).

Ninos by far deserves these 5 stars! This place is the epitome of why I LOVE local, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Before I get into the delicious food, their service is exceptional. From order to walking out, these business owners know how to treat their customers. A friend of mine was craving legit Greek food when I stumbled upon this Yelp profile and Ninos was conveniently down the street from us. This place is probably in a more remote area of the Biltmore area, along 16th Street. It is a charming house with a good amount of tables inside and some bench tables outside. Our party of 7 were the only patrons at the time, so were served in a timely manner and all our food came out in about 15 minutes which to me is great considering our party and number of orders. I believe our party ordered pretty much every single platter on the menu (gyro, lamb, chicken breast, falafel) and each platter comes with pita bread, salad, rice, AND fries with side of tzatziki sauce for less than $10 each. I had the pleasure of trying each platter (yes, I'm THAT person) and oh my goodness... SO SO GOOD! Every meat has great flavor and every element on the platter is delicious and fresh. Here's what sets Ninos apart: they made a mistake on my order of a gyro plate, or rather they did not hear it. Everyone else had got their food and when I asked if my gyro plate was coming, they quickly apologized and said it was coming up. I then looked at my receipt and realized they did not bill me for it. When I told them it wasn't paid for and not to bother because I had more than enough to share with my boyfriend and parents, they insisted on making my gyro plate at no cost. Of course I gave them a hefty tip - what I would have paid for the gyro plate. They deserved it! And that's not all. They ran out of rice for my platter and in consolation, gave us a hummus appetizer on the house! Needless to say, our entire experience was excellent. They were so generous and attentive - gave us so much more than what we asked for and expected in terms of side sauces, additional pita bread, and drinks. And most importantly, one of THE BEST Greek food joints in Phoenix. Hands down. I definitely will be a regular here. THANK YOU YELP and YELPERS for this successful find!"], ["Nader A.", "Let me sum things up in one sentence, and this is me talking.. I made one salad from Ninos two meals. I took half of it home.Ho...ly...gyro. I was craving some Med food badly yesterday, and, low and behold, I jumped on the Yelp app. I found Ninos after passing by several other joints. I didn't realize that this was at the same location as the failed burger joint from a few months back until I rolled up. But, after a brief hesitation, I figured, eff it. I'm super happy I did because it's reasonably-priced Mediterranean food with flavor and generous portions to boot! Seriously, a large Greek salad is enough for two people with big appetites. I've gone to so many places with \"bleh\" Greek salads that are generally just skimpy. Who wants to pay $10 for a shallow bed of iceberg, half a portion of gyro meat, and three piece of red onion? Not me, that's who! I got a mountain of salad, and I'll probably order the regular size from now on unless I want to take half home.So go. Show your support to the super chill staff, and help build this place's rep up a bit. I'm already looking forward to going back when I get my cravings. Great portions and solid flavor alone would have been enough, but the people there were great as well. Go."], ["Heather F.", "Great neighborhood restaurant! I had the chicken souvlaki pita.

The meat, while a generous portion, was the generic, processed gyro meat. There was a very small amount of tzatziki \u00a0sauce on it, so the gyro was dry.. The salad was again a nice portion, but the cheese sprinkled on top did not taste like feta.. Maybe just a very bland goat cheese. None of the flavor that a good feta provides. And my biggest complaint on the salad was the dressing. I have had many a Greek Salad in my day, and they always come with an oil and vinegar based dressing, with oregano, lemon juice, etc.. This salad had what tasted like Ranch as the dressing. I try to frequent small, mom and pop owned businesses when i can.

This ranking may seem a little harsh because I already stated that I enjoyed my lunch, but let me give you a quick run-down on my opinion. I ordered the gyro platter to go.Plusses: Clean, friendly employees. TONS of meat. Salad was amazingly good and fresh. They offer the option of rice or fries offered as a side, and the rice was great. Tzatziki sauce was one of the better ones I've had; quite a bit of dill whereas most in the valley are almost pure yogurt.Negatives: The gyro meat was a tad dry. The seasoning was average - which means it was not bad. Also, despite having enough meat to make 3 or 4 gyros, I didn't have enough onions or tomatoes to even make two. The proportions were off. I'll eat my leftovers after I go home and make some more side items.But this is nitpicking... the platter was $8.50 and a single gyro (with fries or salad) is $7.25. The deal is outstanding.Since this restaurant is fairly new, I'll give a quick run-down on other items on the menu.Appetizers include falafel, hummus, dolmades, spanakopita, zucchini, mushrooms and even chicken nuggets and jalapeno poppers. All are $4.50 or under, plus they have Greek Wings for $6.50.They obviously have gyros and pasta... and they offer pita pizzas; Greek, Italian and Veggie. If their side salad is this impressive, I need to try one of their full salads. They even offer salmon or shrimp salads for $8.25! Greek, Chicken Caesar, Garden and pasta salad are all available. Very reasonably priced.They have shrimp a few different ways on pasta platters, and specials like Italian sausage. They have a sandwich selection including Italian beef, chicken parmesan, cheesesteak, meatball, fish and pork among others. They also have quarter pound and half pound burgers.All of their meals are pretty much between 6 and 9 bucks.Since it's convenient for me, I will definitely go back. I recommend it, although it isn't my favorite gyro place in the city. It earns above average marks, so 3 stars from me for now.

I was very excited to check it out as I like this type of food and it's close to my house and it got great reviews otherwise. Waitress was kind of short & unfriendly to say the least. We ordered and I had a chicken salad. Upon commencement of eating I came upon what looked like an unwashed lettuce.. I carefully inspected it and moved it aside dismissing the possibility... Very soon after I found another piece of unwashed lettuce (romaine) right after a slight feeling of sand in my mouth, now truly inspected it - sure enough it looked like dirt that has not been washed of produce (just like when you buy loose lettuce at the grocery store); decided I had enough (I hardly got any progress on the food). I let the waitress know and she proceeded to convince me it was the salad dressing (because I guess I don't know the difference). Then as she took the plate, she said: \"you should have told me sooner\". WTF?? What does it even mean? I said: \"no, it should have been washed!\" At that point I was fed up with the unfriendliness and I kind of forcefully rebuffed her. \u00a0I haven't ordered anything aft that. They brought soup as a means of settling it all down (as I mentioned I liked the soup because my parents ordered the soup as an appetizer which they didn't like but I did so I ended up eating it). I declined but said I would take pistachio ice cream (they only had 2 on the menu - vanilla & pistachio). Well, pistachio ice cream ended up being vanilla ice cream with few ground pistachios on top of it.. I mean I don't even know what to say. When I read pistachio ice cream I expect pistachio ice cream just like vanilla or chocolate or strawberry. It wasn't worth arguing.

I ate Greek salads throughout Greece though and I was hoping for fresh tomatoes, kalamata olives and fresh greens and feta.Oh well. I'm not in Greece anymore.The spices on the chicken and the way it was cooked was phenomenal! The onion and tomatoes and yogurt sauce all combined in a delicious melody of flavors I've missed for a while now.The price of 8 dollars for lunch is great especially considering you can blow that on crap at Wendy's instead.I think if the salad had blown me away and the decor was updated a bit, I'd give more stars.

While the food is good and our waiter was good the responder is a piece of work. It should be known that my service animal was wearing a vest with an insignia on it. The question should have been answered just by that. The fact that I and anyone in ear shot could hear her was calling undue attention. Whatever the health codes etc are the ADA is VERY CLEAR and this restaurant is this/close to violating that act. ----review and response below.......The restaurant service and food were really good. Everything tasted fine and was presented beautifully. The drawbacks were just minor but they added up...as did the bill. Our waiter was friendly efficient and left us to our devices while we ate after he checked on how we liked things. He did however take a long time to bring the bill. The drawbacks were as follows: We have a service dog and they made a bigger fuss than necessary. We could hear a woman (I am assuming the owner) asking repeatedly if the Maitre d'hotel checked to make certain she was a service dog. He assured her several times, yet she loudly asked him again to verify it. Had the restaurant been crowded it would have been embarrassing enough for me to consider leaving. It is really no one's business besides mine that I have a service animal. Not that I can hide it, but the woman made it seem as though she doubted my disability and or need. The prices were pretty high for what was served. I think 2 people should be able to leave a Greek restaurant for under $60 a person even with wine appetizers desert and coffee. We didn't order the most expensive wine either. Just a Greek Rhoditis. Ultimately I would probably go back but I might try other places first. Being a former Chicago resident a lot of places I go to for Greek food end up being compared to the phenomenal restaurants one finds in Greek Town there. The establishment replied to this comment on 06.28.2014:We regret that you felt the response to your dog was \"over the top\" - however, as the Health Dept is adamant about no dogs other than genuine service dogs in a food establishment - it was necessary to determine that the server had the correct information.. Your server was not a maitre d'hotel and as there have been language barriers that resulted in miscommunication in the past it was important to ensure there was no misunderstanding. There were other issues that unfortunately you were not aware of. We have had many, many diners with service dogs and as well, we have had guests who have \"laughingly\" called their pets \"service\" dogs. In the interests of meeting strict health code parameters it is better to err on the side of caution. We are here to provide a healthy environment and will continue to strive to surpass these expectations regarding both the environment and of course the food.

I used to live in the area for about 4 years before moving back to the midwest and Greekfest was a place I could come to, to treat myself for any celebration I deemed necessary. My wife and I had our first \"business date\" here and the rest is history. We were in the early planning stages with Susan to have our wedding here, but certain circumstances had everything move to the east coast. On my first visit here back in 2006, my parents and I learned that Tony brought all his herbs from Greece and transplanted them here. You can taste the difference in the food and realize that this is not your run of the mill Greek restaurant you can find just about anywhere in the US. Tony thought about the texture and taste to each dish on the menu. I believe I have just had about everything on the menu during my 4 year residence there and everything had a unique and distinct taste from the last meal. My Yiayia always used to make me, my brother and my cousins beautiful food and I always would set the standards by her TLC cooking. Tony, does the same. The amount of TLC he puts into his food is unmatchable.The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful. We also learned on our first visit, that he brought back as much copper and tin items that he could when he immigrated over. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with the items and the white table cloths and walls bring you to the islands of the Agean sea. I could always feel transplated when I would step through the door.During your meal service from the exceptional serving staff, Susan makes the rounds to the each table getting to know everyone on a personal level. Over the four years, we have gotten to know each other as well as we could from those 5 minute conversations, but she is able to recall what we spoke of the last time. That is hard to find these days. Someone that listens.I wish this place much success and when I am back in Phoenix, I can not wait to give them another visit and feel like I am sitting in Yiayia's kitchen eating the food I grew up loving.By the way, ask for a bag of kourabedis before you leave ;)."], ["Elena C.", "My entire family is Greek and I lived in Greece for 10 years.

Best dolmades in town, NOT from a can. They taste like my grandmother's. The owner, Susan, greets every table, while her husband cooks everything. The octopus is perfect, and so is the calamari, and Aegean Eggplant. Authentic Greek music plays in the background always, and the servers are great.

The Greek salad was also excellent, while the Steak Makedonias (filet mignon with reduced cabernet-pomegranate sauce) was tasty, but a little dry at the edges -- they recommended medium-rare, but I ordered it medium, and the result was more like medium-well.

I had a dream is more than an ABBA greek tribute. \u00a0But here is my reality...Having recieved awesome directions not thanks to my Garmin which placed the restuarant to the right versus the left off 19th and Camelback, but from the owner's wife, I pulled into an empty Tuesday night parking lot about an hour and a half before closing. \u00a0Perhaps this was my very first mistake but with this economy, I realized that the place might have been hurting more than my yearning for horiatiki and tzatziki. \u00a0Still, the women's voice was alluring and authentic and promising.Enter stage left, a host. \u00a0Truly, I thought \u00a0that I was part of an elaborate prop set for what would be a Greek tragedy. \u00a0The place is certainly capable visually of transporting you to Ellada. \u00a0The place was also as barren as an off season tourist trap near Plakka. \u00a0The two other people there seemed to be regulars.I admit that I was VERY impressed with the menu. \u00a0Again promising. \u00a0I went ahead and ordered Ktopodi traditional and kalamarakia. \u00a0Homemade bread that was made the last time the restaurant was full appeared at the table with sweet butter that was also frozen at that same time. \u00a0A wine list featuring more Greek wines than anyplace else was also promising, but I knew I would have a long drive back and well, you know me and that speeding thing on Interstate 17...I digress...After waiting for almost 25 minutes, I got one tentacle of \u00a0what must have been the world's smallest octopus and that octopus was suffering from anorexia. \u00a0It was camoflauged in a sea of fava bean paste to give it a fuller appearance. \u00a0It was dry and not tasty. \u00a0To be more clear... imagine a child's finger being grilled and placed in front of you after being dehydrated. \u00a0Yea. \u00a0That is what it was like.The salad was fair.Meek, but fair. \u00a0Nothing to really yelp about. \u00a0The kalamarakia were horrid. \u00a0I think they were anything but fresh as they were laden in overly fried onions and sopping in oil with the breading stripping away. \u00a0I must have been desperate for the fruit of Poseiden to be enticed in any way to put a forkfull of this stuff in my mouth. \u00a0It was the absolute worse that I have ever experienced. \u00a0Hands down. \u00a0I am certain from the many posted accolades all over the walls of the place, that the GreekFest was indeed great. \u00a0But its day has come and gone and its legendary service and cuisine is all but a page of mythology. \u00a0I was extremely disappointed. \u00a0I am only giving two stars because the server was ok and the setting and music was so authentic. \u00a0I can only beg the Marvrides to consider a return themselves to their heritage of excellence that seems now so far away."], ["John C.", "Wonderful Greek Food offered with Excellent Service in an authentic setting, unfortunately very overpriced. \u00a0Difficult to enjoy a proper meal for under $100 for two people. \u00a0We may be back, but only on special occasions. \u00a0We'd be regulars if prices were reasonable."], ["Thais Z.", "Sooooo good!

The horizontal interior started with the front counter sandwiched in-between two dinning areas. The clean, modern d\u00e9cor was appealing, but also a mismatch with the order first, seat yourself, fast food plastic plate protocol. The spacious layout was underutilized since majority of the foot traffic was for takeout orders.Apparently, the young gentleman who took our order had his eyes glued to the TV. We asked specifically if they had a combo plate that comes with hummus, and he suggested we should order the hummus as a separate item. \u00a0Minutes later, we saw on the flash screen menu that they did have a Chicken and Hummus Plate ($9.25), but we were told the kitchen had already made our food, and it was too late to change our order.The food still took some time to come after we had talked to the server. The Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus ($4.95) was smooth, creamy, and spread well on the warm spongy pita bread. To our disappointment, the hummus did not carry any heat or taste of jalapeno. The appetizer did not come as advertised, nor did it looked similar to the photo on the menu.Souvlaki Plate ($9.95) the sliced pork loin was tender, and coupled nicely with the sharp onions and rice. Santi noticed the seasoning lacked oregano, so the flavors were flat and lacking complexity. Adding to our disappointment, the portions size was small for the price when compared to other nearby restaurants. Chicken Shawarma ($9.95) came in dark and white meat that was sliced too small. The flavor was lacking and the chicken was dry. Thankfully there was tzatziki to the rescue in an otherwise failed dish. Each of the main entrees also came with their delicious pita bread. They were not homemade, but I do recommend them.Many similar restaurants offer a salad, hummus, or other sides as a part of the meal, but not here. The lone server at the register was mostly focused on the football game the entire time we were there. His lack of professionalism kicked into a higher gear when he told another customer in a disrespectful manner that he would have to pay for the same price by forfeiting his drink. Every phases of the meal was done in bad taste. We will not be returning."], ["Minounique L.", "I'm use to my gyros with plenty of sauce & lettuce, however, this one met my expectations.

You're going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is. The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare. And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. I'm not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, I'd be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm.... I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday, and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue.

The place was completely empty, which maybe should have been a warning. My friend and I had decided to come here because we could get food and it was also a bar ( hence the name bar and grill). Well, the bar is more like the bar one would have in their home... there are a few bottles of alcohol there, but a bar that does not make. So cocktails were (sadly) not had. We did, against our better judgment, get some food. I had a chicken pita and we shared some greek fries. The fries were alright, just fries with some feta on top essentially. I know the owner ( or whoever was there) made them fresh, so that was a plus. The pita was fairly lackluster. The sauce on it was flavorless and the chicken was underseasoned. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I would want to eat again either. Besides the mediocre food, we were very disappointed by the lackluster service. Like I said, we were the only ones there, but we waited a long time for any drink refills and for our check. The guy who works there (or owns the place) was sitting at his little desk by the kitchen ignoring us most of the time, which I totally get, since having one table is probably excruciatingly boring, but being that they decided to be open for dinner, they should treat it like it's actually business hours.

Like all of a sudden to go boxes magically appeared! Well I didn't wanna piss them off anymore so I said no it's fine I'll get both plates for here and take the leftovers like they wanted. Some other minor things that added up were that I asked for a fork and knife and she only gave me a fork, and I asked for no onions on my plates in which there were obvious pieces of onions on the plate.

I don't mind a little bit of grease because that tells you the meat is fresh and roasted rather than pre-cooked and stored. It also came with really delicious french fries. The hummus was obviously in-house and came with a pita that was steamed so it was very soft and warm. I took it to go and it smelled so good, I almost snuck some on the way home! The gyro and fries came with a canned soda and was $5.99. The hummus was just under $5. A very tasty, filling meal with drink for under $13 with tax is definitely a win!

The owner was extremely friendly and gave me a free bottled water while I waited for my order. It took about 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.I got the gyro combo ($6) and then another gyro ($3.50), in case the first one was good. My wife got the chicken kabab souvlaki plate ($6), my daughter got the chicken souvlaki combo ($6), and we also got an order of the stuffed grape leaves ($6). The gyros were really good, lots of meat and lots of tzatziki dressing (the way I like it), and I ate both of them. My daughter hated the chicken souvlaki but I tasted it and to me it was also quite good. My wife and daughter both loved the rice that came with the chicken souvlaki plate and my wife said her chicken kabab plate was really good, but it only came with 4 pieces of chicken. The plate was enough for my wife but if it was me 4 pieces of chicken would not have made the cut. If \u00a0you have a hearty appetite go with the combo not the plate. The stuffed grape leaves were very lemony. We ate 3 of them but could not finish the rest.Overall we thought the food was good, and the service and prices were GREAT.

Right away, walking in this place feels like visiting family. The menu is simple and the owner himself welcomes you with this big, real, friendly personality that is super refreshing.

It's obvious he takes great pride in his place and he should. The gryos are amazing. Everything from the homemade tziki and freshly sliced meat. The Greek salad is $1 up charge and well worth it. baklava is homemade and so delicious. It sells out though so don't wait until next time to get it!

I called to make sure that they have a \"Gyro Pit/the machine\".... Yes they did.... So we went to pick up some Gyros. A bakery used to be here which closed down and was replaced by this place. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in. Clean as a whistle and decorated so Chic.... Tom, the owner was also the cook and knows is Greek/Middle Eastern cuisine. Very creative with his special. We also got the Gyros which were only $3.50. We thought for that price they would either scrimp on the quality or the quantity of the meat. Neither were sacrificed. Tom just opened this place up in Feb 2010. He delivers too. I picked up 4-6 menus to give to my neighbors. One of the best in town..."], ["Violet B.", "Delicious gyros at only 3.50.cheap and good eats"], ["Amanda I.", "I ate here after craving a beef gyro...so that is exactly what I ordered.

From the first to the last bite. I wanted more. The fries were good; typical, but good with ketchup. They were nicely salted and not crispy, which is how I like them. \u00a0Back to the gyro... it was very flavorful, the meat was tender, the bread was very soft and fresh, and the tasty cucumber sauce was in perfect proportion.

Yesterday, because they are close to work and I was starving, I decided to hit up Zoes for the only thing I ever really eat there - the Grilled Pimento cheese on rye which I highly recommend! Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.Now for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options. I had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese.

Anyway, I fall into the category of people who think the food induces yawning. I had the Greek Pita and there was nothing Greek about it. My chicken, though, was NOT dry at all...quite tasty by itself in fact. See, its not that the food here doesn't taste good, its just that its nothing special...a sandwich packed in your lunchbox is just as good as what I had here. This wrap tasted like the thousands of others I've had. (that's right, thousands) I didn't read reviews before I went, and I did it on purpose. Its right down the street, they serve sandwiches, so I had decided that this is a place that I will find something to like about. Another place to add to my wall-of-menus. But...I will visit 2 more times for a total of 3. 3 strikes and you're out is fair, right? On the plus side, even though the food was boring, it was still fresh.

I am not a fan of the overdesigned feel of the restaurant, but whatever.Today, I departed from my normal and had a different sandwich. I asked the girl at the register nicely if it could not be too heavily toasted because I've had some turkey sandwiches nearly blackened to where the bread was useless. She not only proceeded to do a subtle half-eye roll, but she was outright unpleasant. I've never seen her there before and this surprised me because usually the people up front are really nice. Will I go back? Yes. But I'll make sure to not go to her if there is someone else available or just order it on the phone so that way if she does answer, I can't see her roll her eyes at me.

When you call Zoes, they have your phone number in their computer, which tells the person answering what you typically order. So I go into the restaurant, impressed by the new look of Zoes. The floors and tables were clean (Awesome!) and they have new furniture, which has created a warmer feeling in the dining room. The girl who took my order and cashed me out was pleasant and very excited about my free lunch coupon. She was endearing. I left the restaurant with a smile on my face!

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of \u00a0token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I \u00a0immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but."], ["Rachel T.", "Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local.

The bf said the falafel was too dry for him, but I found it pretty decent. My only complaint was that there was too much tahini sauce in my falafel, yet not enough in the bf's... we probably should have traded!Other than that, I thought the pita was absolutely delicious. The fries were so-so, don't think I will order them in the future.That said, the ambiance of The Greek Pita is really cool-it's well decorated and nicely set up. Lots of seating, lots of booths to make it semi-private. It's also really cool to see them shaving the gyro meat right in the kitchen! I mean, I'm not a meat eater, but the bf thought it was cool, so you know... if you're into that...It's fairly well priced-- about $8 falafel and fries plate. Bf thought it was a little expensive for the quality, but I would imagine that's about average.We will definitely be going again-- next on our list is the gyro for him, and the hummus platter for me!"], ["Lisa V.", "My coworkers and I love this place for a lunch stop. \u00a0The food is always fresh, as it is made to order, and very flavorful. \u00a0My favorite is the #10 - chicken Kebab pita - I get it Greek style which means an addition of tatziki and feta. \u00a0The chicken is all white meat, which is a something I am huge stickler about. \u00a0The hummus and gyro are also very good. \u00a0A lunch will run you about $9-$10."], ["Eddie U.", "It's a small joint but comfortable. I was hesitant about having Greek food but once I read what was on the menu...those falafels were all mine! Tasty and held their crunch within the pita bread covered in sauce, along with lettuce, tomato and onions. This Bronx kid's been missing his NYC food variety so this was a welcomed treat. Yummy, yummy, Eddie Machete had food in his tummy!"], ["Morgan D.", "Delicious!!! Such an unassuming sign out front, you'd never guess the inside held the best gyros sandwiches and chicken salads. You won't regret trying this place! :)"], ["Matthew R.", "Nice sized Gyro and tasty fries"], ["Ann B.", "Uggggg----this place is so yummy, but they cannot get a carryout order right to save their lives! Every time I order from Greek Pita, my order is incorrect. I repeat the order, have them repeat it back, check the bag. It is still always wrong. I keep going back because the food is really good. We order out from here about twice a month. They used to forget the sauce. Yesterday, even after the woman on the phone repeated the order back to me twice, they gave us the wrong menu item. Last time they did not give the person picking up the food the drinks that came with the meals. As indicated by my past reviews on other less than par experiences, I will continue to frequent this spot, despite my misgivings. I am truly a glutton for punishment."], ["Jennifer L.", "Best chicken kabobs. \u00a0I love this place. I crave their food at least once a week. Yummy and nicely priced."], ["Ben A.", "I have been here twice in two weeks. Gyros are delicious and service is great! Everyone is friendly with a smile. Will be back very soon."], ["Jeff L.", "Come here sometimes when I have business at Best Buy.Always consistent and tasty."], ["Audra G.", "Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting. \u00a0I wish they could just know by my # what I always order."], ["Jamie Z.", "Been here a few times with my BFF and we really like this place. It is clean, the prices are somewhat reasonable, and the service is nothing out of the ordinary. The food is made to order relatively quick and the Sherwarma Gyro is so delicious... that I feel guilty afterwards. But, it is well worth it!I plan to frequent this place on a regular basis and love the fact that it is fairly close to work. I believe they have the best Gyro's in the Phoenix Metro area. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."], ["Marty F.", "I went here a few weeks ago for the first time for lunchtime and was blown away. \u00a0My god, the food here is delicious. \u00a0 I got the beef gyro combo and the mass amount of food was huge. \u00a0You could easily split it with two people!If you \u00a0havent been here, you gotta stop and eat here. \u00a0Great food and great staff!"], ["Kayla S.", "We order from here for lunch and it is excellent! \u00a0 \u00a0So far I have had the gyros which is very good, the spanakopita is what you would expect, but my favorite is the chicken kebab wrap. \u00a0 \u00a0I get it with the tzatsiki sauce, the chicken is cooked to perfection and with the tomato, lettice and sauce in a pita, it is perfect. \u00a0 Great food!"], ["Carmelo W.", "Friendly service, nice clean place, average pricing & yummy Gyros!"], ["Jay R.", "Un-friggin-believeable! \u00a0In town on business and looking for something different. \u00a0Where I grew up we had a huge Greek Community and there were at least 10 Greek Restaurants in my area. \u00a0Tasting the food here reminded me of some of those restaurant. \u00a0Everything was tasty and fresh. \u00a0I will be eating there for dinner every day that I am here in phoenix. \u00a0Great Find!"], ["Bill F.", "My Son and Daughter in Law (DIL) come here frequently and it's close to their work. \u00a0My wife and I love Greek food and thought this is worth trying. We wanted something different then your normal, burgers, subs, pizza for Lunch.This Greek Pita place is close to Thunderbird Rd and interstate 17. Sort of on the South West side of the two major cross streets. \u00a0It's east of 30th ave.We went on Wed afternoon about 1:45pm. The place wasn't crowded, probably just missed the lunch crowd, they had a steady stream of people coming in. At any given time around 5 to 7 groups or people came in ordered or stayed and ate their meals.I liked the fact if you stayed, they brought your food to your table. The layout is very similar to a fast food burger or sub joint. our order came out in about 10 minutes. Our DIL said sometimes they are fast, other times it can be really slow depending on the # of people in the joint. It's nice they have high chairs since our 9 month old grandson was with us.What we ordered: 3 sodas with unlimited refills, no charge for refills1 Appetizer combo (Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, dolmas (3), falafel & 2 pitabread1 #1 Gyro combo, I substituted onion rings for fries and there was a $1.25 extra charge1 \u00a0Gyro pita which meant no fries or drink1 #11 Chicken gyro- no sauce1 Dolmas.Total bill for 4 adults including tax was $40 on the spot. \u00a0Was a bit more expense than a Micky D's combo or Burger King combo which probably would have been about $20 to $25.My wife liked the appetizer platter and loved the warmed pita bread. \u00a0I thought the falafel on the appetizer was overcooked, the dolmas is served cold, I like dolmas warm to hot. couldn't really differentiate the taste of hummus vs baba ghanouj, but I don't eat enough of it to really say.My Gyro tasted good, they gave enough Tsatziki sauce to my satisfaction.Over all the food was average to good, we all enjoyed it, I would come back for quick Greek Food on the fly."], ["DS K.", "You usually KNOW what you like immediately & why the moment the plate arrives ...Big LOVE for this place."], ["Jenn N.", "I've ordered take out here twice. \u00a0Both times were very positive. \u00a0First time I tried it was when I first moved here in the Spring when it was like 100 degrees already. \u00a0I have 2 dogs that I had to leave in the car (with the engine and A/C on) while I ran inside to place my order. \u00a0I told the waitress I'd just be outside the door because of my dogs so I'll come in to get my food. \u00a0Instead of waiting for me to come in to get it....she came out and handed to me!! \u00a0How nice!Second time I came here was a few days ago when the temperature has cooled down a lot. But, again, I left the dogs in the car with the engine on and the A/C going. \u00a0And AGAIN!....she ran out and gave me my food! \u00a0I love their service and their Sherwarma gyro is freakin awesome-tastic."], ["Hilin S.", "This place is so good! Every time a friend comes to visit, I always take them here once during their stay. The chicken shawarma sandwich is my absolute fave. There is something about the sauce and bread that makes the whole thing amazing. Their fries are pretty tasty as well. The food gets you pretty full so I think you get your money's worth (under ten dollars for a meal). Check it out!"], ["Brian K.", "I was very impressed by the friendly greeting when I ordered my gyros sandwich, fries and drink. The cashier girl ( very cute by the way) also brought my food out as soon as it was ready. I was very happy with the food and service. I will order the salad instead of fries next time, just to eat healthier. The music was kinda weird, but I guess that a greek thing. I will eat here more often."], ["David B.", "Fast food Greek. Pretty good considering. I had the felafel plate which was huge. Small side Greek salad, 6 felafel balls, lots of rice, and pita bread. Enough for two meals. Tahini sauce was good. Salad dressing could be better."], ["Jake D.", "I'm fairly new to the Greek party, and I've always seen this place kind of tucked away behind Best Buy when I'd drive by. \u00a0Today some folks from work and I had a Greek craving and wanted to try something new. \u00a0So I figured why not....Food was very good, the service was friendly, and the place was pretty full of people. \u00a0Everyone in our group was satisfied. \u00a0A great addition to the lunch rotation!"], ["Nate F.", "I love this place! I can't speak to \"authenticity\" but I know what I like, I like Greek food, and these guys make some of the best I've found in Phoenix. Who cares if they also have hamburgers on the menu? (I can't believe the things Yelpers will \"ding\" a business for... come on people, you're not writing for Zagat). Back to the food. I'm a big fan of Pita Jungle, but the food here is better. True, the place isn't big, and it might not be the best atmosphere if you need to bring a bunch of people from work or something; but for lunch, or take-out, or small parties, you'll love it!"], ["Rich M.", "Awesome Greek food and wonderful service. It's a family run business and the food is fabulous. If you're in the area and craving Greek food, this is the spot."], ["Wiley F.", "Great food, good people. The Greek salad is da bomb. Just saying."], ["Wes N.", "Pretty good fast food Greek chow spot in NoPho. Nothing so amazing that it has me running back or craving it randomly. Good selection of iced teas. Tasty hummus & dolmas. I'd like to see a non-falafel meal option for vegetarians. Perhaps a greek salad/pita & hummus/rice plate?"]]}
