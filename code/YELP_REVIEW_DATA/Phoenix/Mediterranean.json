Outside has an amazing patio (1/5th of iy can be seen in my picture) which overlooks pheonix.While having drinks, i noticed they were underpoured SEVERELY and cost $14 each. \u00a0After several.. I was begining to get annoyed by the size and made a commeent to the waiter. \u00a0He apologized and gave me an additonal Macallan on the rocks on him. \u00a0So although yhe drinks were severely underpoured, an attempt was made to please me.The food ordered to the table:CHOPPED SALADLOBSTER BISQUESAUSAGE RAVIOLIDUCK SPECIALSHORT RIB (BONELESS)VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAMThe lobster bisque was very very tasty and the other person in my party enjoyed his salad. \u00a0We split the ravioli appetizer which consists of 3 raviolis but we each received 2. \u00a0They had broccoli rabe sausage and a nice filling.I forgot to mention the two types of bread for the table came with a selection of 3 amazing spreads:: blood orange butter, pesto, goat cheese reduction.The duck was a great taste but I ordered the short rib and only \"tried\" th e duck. \u00a0The short rib was a tiny bit overcooked but i am mentioning it for the sake of being accurate... it wasnt bad and didnt take away from how good it was. \u00a0The polenta and veg inckuded underneth the shortrib also had a great taste.It's important to note, 4 scotches (one complimentry), 2 bourbons and an additional 2 orders of ice cream were added to the bill before seeing $187.50. \u00a0To dome this may dound a bit much, but I dont believe those people travel to New York. \u00a0Furthermore, I understand price should be relative to the geo location and I still dont believe it was OVERLY excessive. \u00a0This place is great for those who want a mountaintop dining and drinking experience with high quality food.My trip consisted of visits to Tomasos, The Mission, & Different Pointe of View. \u00a0Different Pointe of View would come in second to Tomasos.. but just because I am italian and love pasta :-) \u00a0 If I am to be in PHX again, it will be a must gor me to visit Different Pointe of View again.... wiyhe the misses most likely."], ["Manuel C.", "I came with my wife for an anniversary dinner.

My husband and I went to DPOV last night to kick off restaurant week. We have both been before and knew the food would be great; and that it was. Our service however, was not. We had an older gentleman with white hair as our server who nearly ruined the experience for us. As I stated before the online menu for restaurant week is not accurate...I had chosen DPOV because it claimed to be serving duck confit (best thing I've ever ate). This was not the case and when my husband went out on a limb just to make sure we couldn't order it our server said \"not if you want restaurant week!\" okaaaay....understandable but maybe approach it diferently (ie. 'unfortuantely it's not one of the featured items OR I could do that for an extra sur-charge'). We ordered our starters and entrees, never did he ask if we enjoyed our starters but when he did ask about the main course he walked by saying \"enjoying?\" while not waiting for a resonse. Finally, once the dessert menu was delivered and we had decided he stood at our table pen in hand for about 10 seconds and said \"yes?\" At this point in time we were done...both of shook our heads and ordered wanting to get away from this guy as soon as possible. Like I said - food is, and always has been then last 3 times we've been, great! I may even go back for a glass of wine and the duck confit raviolis (because duck confit is THAT good) but I will be sure to request not to sit in this gentlemens section.

I think though that $12 for a few leaves of a salad was very funny. It was good but this is exactly how it tastes at home (ok I make good salad) I can imagine this to be a great place for someone who wants to rest after a stressful day and watch the city lights from a place tucked away on a mountain - and doesn't mind spending minimum $65 per person. \u00a0Maybe it is a good idea to check if the pork, or any meat is grass fed - which would justify the price, or are the prices justified by elevation of the restaurant - which, at least for me, is not worth it."], ["Michael T.", "This place has simply gorgeous views of Phoenix. Two levels of this restaurant have extensive glass panoramas that take advantage of the height of the hill on which the restaurant sits.That being said, the high prices of this restaurant make you think you're getting haute cuisine, outstanding customer service, in addition to the beautiful vistas. This unfortunately fell short with us.While the food was very well executed, the menu was predictable and dull. We had the venison and the filet. Both were cooked to perfection. The portions were smaller than I had expected, and the desserts were even smaller than I thought possible. For the money I was charged, \u00a0I would expect a small, yet satisfying portion. I'm NOT a big eater by a long shot, but had I come in hungry, I would've left hungry, even after appetizer, entree and dessert.The service was satisfactory for a cheaper restaurant. At these prices, I had expected superior service. We were left waiting for 10 minutes after we finished our appetizers before the server took our order for dinner (we spaced our dinner out and didn't order everything up front). The server didn't ask us if we wanted additional cocktails either. We received better service from the runners than we did our server.All in all, this is a great place to go for a special occasion, but if you want superior service, reasonable portion sizes, and interesting menu, go to Elements at Sanctuary. The view isn't as \"good\" but it makes up for it in all other ways. Or consider Orange Sky at the Talking Stick. Julio there gave us the best service we've had since moving to the valley."], ["Pepper T.", "Different Point of View is a Lovely Restaurant with Breath taking Views. Most of the food and Service I had was very good. This would be a Four star review if a few execution problems didn't occur. I am basing my rating on price point.Both entrees were less than warm especially the New York Strip. I don't order steak often but when I do I look forward to a very good steak that's tender, tasty and hot like off the grill. \u00a0My husband thought the steak was cold but I say it was room temperature. I didn't send it back or say anything because it was tasty and cooked nicely and I didn't want it cooked more and I also didn't want my husband's Pork to sit more. My waiter did come to check on us and asked how it tasted and I said fine because it did taste fine.At this point I was teetering between three and four stars.But another execution problem occurred with the Chiffon Date Cake. The cake is made ahead of time and kept chilled in a refrigerator. I am certain that freshly made the Pistachio Cream is delicious but after chilling it just turned into hard putty that you can't eat. Other issues with this dessert are I didn't recognize anything in the Chiffon Date Cake as Dates. I don't know if the cake had dates in it. I don't know if I got the wrong one either. \u00a0I tasted the cake and to be honest it tasted like a dry sorta sponge cake. I do note the coconut lime saffron sorbet was delicious and I used that to soak and moisten up the dry sponge of cake. I did question the waiter about the cake and he assured me I had the correct one. He also said the pastry chef was on vacation.Even with the Summer Menu Pricing I feel three stars is an accurate rating for the execution of the steak and dessert in an upscale place.Possibly a slightly off night."], ["Ann M.", "The view is amazing and we were lucky to be there in time to watch the sun go down. We chose to eat outside which was taking a chance because when the sun went down it got cold pretty fast. I would have thought they would have had some heaters outside. Both the service and food were outstanding. We never felt rushed and we were given great suggestions for food. We also received information about the mountains and areas around the property. The restaurant is high up the hill so make sure you keep following the signs to the restaurant. There is also a great lounge area and we were planning on having an after dinner drink there but it was so cold inside, we had to leave. The restaurant was very cold also.

She had the Pear Salad ($13) - the menu clearly misleads when it says it consists of \"pears\" (she got tiny bits of pears). I kid you not, it came to her with about half a handful of some kind of green sprouty looking grass plopped on the plate. \u00a0The \"pears\" consisted of 3 nearly invisible round scoops (maybe half a teaspoon each) of pears, another teaspoon of cheese and some thin dribbles of sauce splattered on this HUGE plate. \u00a0The size of the plate literally dwarfed the so-called \u00a0\"salad\" - it was ludicrous. \u00a0I mean, I could have played a game of chess on the plate and would never have touched any part of the salad. \u00a0Sure, the wife said it tasted great, but REALLY? \u00a0Four itty bitty half-bites? The pear and cheese components could easily fit into the center ring of a teacup saucer with room to spare. \u00a0I ordered the oysters, which turned out to be 5 of the smallest (1.5 inch - maybe) oysters I have ever seen, laid out on a bed of SALT with rosemary leaves (not edible). \u00a0The oysters tasted great, but again, I'm not a midget so why serve me a micro appetizer?ENTREESShort ribs. For once they told the truth - these were VERY short ribs! \u00a0They were the smallest short ribs I've EVER been served - at 1\"x2.5\" - on top of a creamy rice mix that tasted just as good as I could get from a box of Rice-A-Roni. \u00a0I forced myself to eat it - it didn't taste bad, but - meh - it was oh so ordinary. \u00a0The meat tasted excellent, but really? \u00a0All that for $35? \u00a0This was billed as an entr\u00e9e, but you could sure fool me! \u00a0Even most appetizers have more meat than this entr\u00e9e.. \u00a0I could have ordered a really large steak plus much more for that price at a really good restaurant. \u00a0And the butternut squash Risotto advertised in the menu as part of the meal was just the thinnest paintbrush swipe of paste...I could see the plate through it. \u00a0Not even worth putting on the menu in my opinion. Then there was a clump of limp wilted spinach-like greens between the rice and the meat. \u00a0Those greens were soooo bitter that it totally ruined my palate for the rest of the food. \u00a0When I asked our waiter if he had tasted the greens he responded by telling me that they were grown locally by some young kids who were trying to make some inroads selling food to them (thus avoiding an answer to my question). \u00a0I asked him again if he had tasted it, and he replied that he had not. \u00a0Folks, if the waiter at a place this high-end serves his guests anything he has not personally tasted, then he's not doing his job. \u00a0On my way out of the restaurant I deliberately snaked my way through some tables to see if anyone else had left those greens on their plate, and sure enough I saw some plates that had. \u00a0Hey chef! \u00a0Get a clue! (or do you even bother to check and see what your customers leave on their plates?) \u00a0My wife fared much better with two fish fillets and 4 medium prawns on a bed of rice and greens. \u00a0She said it tasted great. \u00a0I was VERY glad she was happy with her meal. \u00a0If she had voiced any displeasure, I would have sent it all back.I won't go back. \u00a0I would have had a better meal at many other restaurants I can think of. \u00a0The view and service are nice to haves - but the food is paramount - and for what you're charging, you should be ashamed to offer so little on many of the plates we tried, and fail to ensure that EVERY ITEM on those plates tastes great and isn't misrepresented on the menu"], ["Barb V.", "We went for drinks what a fun a beautiful atmosphere. \u00a0We very much enjoyed the ambiance it was very special. \u00a0I wish they would open for lunch!"], ["Jad A.", "This place was Great for our company event Good foodAmazing view and he venue is amazing Highly recommended"]], "Gyro House": [], "The Golden Greek": [["Lisa S.", "Please do yourself a favor and visit this diamond in the rough. \u00a0The service in mediocre at best, but it honestly doesn't matter when you're getting such a delicious meal at a good price. \u00a0The bread is definitely home made and I could probably eat it all day. \u00a0I could die in it and be happy.

Persians are not Arabs. So not Persian food.They had gyros. Gyros are Greek. Even farther off (but closer than grilled cheese). They DID have chicken kababs but you could tell they weren't any more Persian than some chicken I throw on the grille. I hated to give this place a low review because we didn't eat there.

Most middle eastern restaurants create their flavors through excessive amounts of oil and fat. Not here. Fragrant and very aromatic food. I really enjoyed the spinach stew and the sabzi polo rice. While there are the traditional Persian dishes on the menu, there are also creative variants of Persian food including the use tofu. It does have meat on the menu but dedicates two pages to vegetarian entrees. Aside from the cuisine I think what separates this restaurant is the charming environment and personal attention from the chef and owner who often comes out and greets the guests. \u00a0This is a ma and pa restaurant.

For all of you, my fans, I have some news that may rock your world. I went vegan 5 months ago. Margaret Cho does a stand up skit about people you should not F*** with. On the list are gay men, lesbians, vegans, and Bjork. \"Do not f*** with vegans... Do not look vegans in the eye.. If you get in an argument with a vegan, say you're sorry and back away slowly. You don't mess with vegans because they're F******* hungry!\"This is true. I was hungry for 6 weeks until I realized the only two foods that satisfied my hunger are refried beans and hummus. So.. why two stars for a restaurant that caters to vegans?The prices. I am not a cheapskate. I spend a ridiculous amount of money on food. I once spent $500 on a meal for three people - and didn't feel ripped off, because it was worth it.I ordered a vegetarian plate. Humus tabouli, falafel & dolmeh served over white & brown rice. Falafel is topped with tahini. Humus & tabouli served with fresh veggies & homemade nan. So... most places... a meal like this would be 8 dollars. Maybe 14 at a good restaurant. $20 for this... I expect the best on earth and a huge portion.It wasn't. The hummus was pure tahini - awful really. The baba was smoky and kind of grossThe falafel I didn't think was that great. The dolmeh were good. The portion size was a normal Styrofoam take away box with one piece of pita.I will say that the rice was divine. Saffron - y and perfectly cooked. The price was not equivalent to the quantity or quality. I was mad.

In fact, the options are so good that I had a really hard time making up my mind this time around. I finally decided on the vegetable stew with eggplant, and it was amazing! So much food, and it came with a big plate of rice as well. I couldnt even finish it all, and it was soooo good!The chef came out to greet my party and was very nice, and gave us a complimentary starter.I can honestly say that whatever restaurant you decide to go to, it will not be as good as Persian Garden Cafe, and I have been to a lot of restaurants all over the valley.

Persian Garden Cafe is enough for me. First off, there's plenty of meat and seafood on the menu - but - everything can be made vegan. That's right. You can all come out of hiding now. You're safe here.I shared the dolmeh and falafel plate with a friend and was satisfied, but still found room for dessert. Yeah, I've got my priorities straight. It came with four big, crisp, spiced falafel and three FRESH, steamed domlehs. (To anyone who has only had the displeasure of trying a canned dolmeh: now is your time. Feed.) That may appear to be enough to serve one person, but with the heaps of saffron rice, brown lentil-currant-other-tasty-things rice, tahini, tomatoes, and huge basket of flat bread it came with, it was more than enough for two.For dessert, we ordered a slice of carrot cake and chocolate cheesecake. They're both vegan, along with the saffron rice pudding and pumpkin pie on the dessert menu... both of which I'll probably review in the near future. The carrot cake was huge, super sweet, heavily spiced, studded with raisins and walnuts and topped with a dollop of magical cream un-cheese frosting. The chocolate cheesecake was my favorite, probably because it was doused with dark chocolate chips, had a chewy, creamy center, and a crunchy, cookie crust. Last I checked, those are the only things I want from a dessert, ever.Persian Garden Cafe ain't cheap, but the ambiance is warm and pleasant (not to mention, great for groups), the food is fresh, homemade and delicious, and you can get dairy free cheesecake that's better than regular cheesecake.

First off, it was really quite good. The sauce was spectacular, bravo, chef. The ravioli was al dente, which is good, I think I would pull it just a bit soon though because a little texture would help but that's just me. Seriously, I would order it again, it was good.The gyro was as it should be and frigging stacked with meat. Tiziki was on point. Red onion added color and a bit of depth that made it just right. Very good job.The cheese burger was unique, served on baguette and formed to fit perfectly. Somebody put some thought into this dish. One of the better burgers I've had and there are no shortage of burger shops so that's saying something. One of the top 10 in my opinion.The fries are good. Cooked correctly and seasoned well. For me I would have used celery salt on them as opposed to table salt because when next to the gyro and the burger they came across a little plain, but again that's just me, I'm sure other would disagree.The decor is fine, lighting is bright, the shop is clean as it can be, the folks are fun and clever with their approach to customer service, I enjoyed them a lot.So one thing, and I almost hate to say it but kitchen staff should be dressed like kitchen staff. That's important to me, so I was a bit disappointed that they weren't, once again though, that's just one guys opinion and I am equally certain that an informal approach appeals to a lot of people so I am not judging.

They don't skimp on meat portions, so the tzatziki just can't keep up. The amount of tomatoes was a little lacking too, but not really to a fault.My sister-in-law got the chicken pita and was pleased with it as well.I chose fries as my side, but I wish I hadn't. I believe they were frozen store-bought fries that were under-baked and heavily seasoned with season-all.

Thank you Yelp! I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 4 years and had never tried George's until yesterday. The location makes it a bit tough to recognize from the road. The original gyro was fantastic! Has to be the most meat I've ever had in a gyro, and great flavor too! So I took the to-go menu with me and saw something intersting, George's Chicken Faliro. Had it for lunch today :), sliced chicken breast, artichoke hearts and capers, sauteed in olive oil, butter and a little lemon, topped with a bit of feta, all over pasta, outstanding!!! Great value, will definitely be back!"], ["Farzana S.", "The staff here was very friendly, and the food was good! You get a lot of food, but it is a bit pricey for lunch."], ["Thomas O.", "I enjoyed my lunch here!So 3 stars? This ranking may seem a little harsh because I already stated that I enjoyed my lunch, but let me give you a quick run-down on my opinion. I ordered the gyro platter to go.Plusses: Clean, friendly employees. TONS of meat. Salad was amazingly good and fresh. They offer the option of rice or fries offered as a side, and the rice was great. Tzatziki sauce was one of the better ones I've had; quite a bit of dill whereas most in the valley are almost pure yogurt.Negatives: The gyro meat was a tad dry. The seasoning was average - which means it was not bad. Also, despite having enough meat to make 3 or 4 gyros, I didn't have enough onions or tomatoes to even make two. The proportions were off. I'll eat my leftovers after I go home and make some more side items.But this is nitpicking... the platter was $8.50 and a single gyro (with fries or salad) is $7.25. The deal is outstanding.Since this restaurant is fairly new, I'll give a quick run-down on other items on the menu.Appetizers include falafel, hummus, dolmades, spanakopita, zucchini, mushrooms and even chicken nuggets and jalapeno poppers. All are $4.50 or under, plus they have Greek Wings for $6.50.They obviously have gyros and pasta... and they offer pita pizzas; Greek, Italian and Veggie. If their side salad is this impressive, I need to try one of their full salads. They even offer salmon or shrimp salads for $8.25! Greek, Chicken Caesar, Garden and pasta salad are all available. Very reasonably priced.They have shrimp a few different ways on pasta platters, and specials like Italian sausage. They have a sandwich selection including Italian beef, chicken parmesan, cheesesteak, meatball, fish and pork among others. They also have quarter pound and half pound burgers.All of their meals are pretty much between 6 and 9 bucks.Since it's convenient for me, I will definitely go back. I recommend it, although it isn't my favorite gyro place in the city. It earns above average marks, so 3 stars from me for now. I'll re-evaluate once I try more items; especially the dolmade!"], ["Vinnie P.", "I work across the street from George's and have always wondered how the food was there. \u00a0I love gyros and I have a place near where I live that isn't that bad but George's blows it away! \u00a0Yes, it's further of a travel for me but well worth the price of gas. \u00a0My roommate and I couldn't decide what we wanted for dinner and I said there's a Greek joint across the street from where I work. \u00a0I see it gets GREAT reviews on Yelp! \u00a0Wanna give it a try? \u00a0He agreed and off we went. \u00a0We decided to eat in. \u00a0The dining room is nothing special but it's clean and the workers were really friendly. \u00a0My roommate and I both ordered the same thing and we decided to split a Hummus and chips appy. \u00a0The Hummus is home made!!!! \u00a0YUM!! \u00a0 Then they bought out a nice sized Greek Salad for each of us. \u00a0As we got about halfway thru the salad the main course came out. \u00a0We got the Original Gyro platter. \u00a0OMG!!!! \u00a0The portions were HUGE!! \u00a0I took one bite of the meat and I was in love. \u00a0It was perhaps the best tasting gyro I'd ever had. \u00a0The platter came with tzatziki (and plenty of it), sliced red onion, diced tomatoes, french fries (which were basically an afterthought) and pita bread (which was soft and warm). \u00a0It was absolutely delicious. \u00a0I hate to admit this but I ate the WHOLE thing........sans the fries. \u00a0My roommate bought about half of it home with him because he was full. \u00a0The employees came over to check up on us halfway thru the meal which I thought was very nice of them and like I mentioned before, they were very friendly and helpful. \u00a0OH!!!!!

Don't get me started on the fresh falafel, with a side of special spicy sauce, omg. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the hummus and pita bread definitely hit the spot. The meal most certainly impressed me, and the grocery corner was a nice touch. But my very favorite part of the meal was the part where he treated me (and my lunch date) like royalty.

\u00a0The fancier the decor in an ethnic restaurant, the blander the food.Stated differently, what is it about the mystical siren's call of the hole in the wall ethnic restaurant? \u00a0Does the chef assume that because his food is head and shoulders above the rest that he needn't waste money on decorations? \u00a0Or is it simply that the mom & pop chef with his traditional recipes handed down from generation to generation will never be matched by the cookie cutter american culinary school education?This restaurant is very unassumedly named The Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, though it is also a restaurant and grocery store. \u00a0It doesn't look like much from the outside, nor the inside, and would probably fly under most people's radar if it was not for word of mouth passed through Yelp. \u00a0Can you see the diamond lurking under the layer of carbon? \u00a0I sure can.The proprietor, Isam (yes, we're on a first name basis now and you will be, too, by the end of your first visit), is quite a character guaranteed to put a smile on the face of even the WORST sourpuss. \u00a0Before our first visit we called him by phone to make sure the restaurant would be open when we arrived and he was friendly and welcoming. \u00a0When we finally arrived he welcomed us like old friends. \u00a0I ordered the grilled combo and my coworker ordered the Lebanese Chicken. \u00a0Both plates came with a choice of Greek Salad of Tabbouli with a fresh warm pita and rice. \u00a0I wasn't sure which to choose, so Isam guided me gently toward the Tabbouli which he makes FRESH 5 TIMES EVERY DAY. \u00a0Yes, you can tell this man is incredibly gifted in the making of Tabbouli, which is a thing of beauty, colorfully decorated with red and green pepper rings, white couscous, tangy red tomato, crisp white onions, and ruby toned sliced beets over dark greens. \u00a0It is beautiful, but tastes even better. \u00a0I ordered a diet soda in spite of the prominently displayed Yelp tip recommending the lemonade (\"Your life will change as you discover the super powers you've acquired from the lemonade.\") as I'm not usually a big lemonade fan. \u00a0My coworker ordered the lemonade and I ordered the birds nest baklava with glistening green pistachio pieces covering the top to eat while I waited for the food to arrive.My coworker took one sip of the lemonade, which is made with honey and rose water - SHEER GENIUS - and couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. \u00a0I traded him half of my baklava for a taste and couldn't BELIEVE how amazing it was - TRULY LIFE CHANGING. \u00a0Isam brought me a large cup of this elixir of the gods and made my entire day.When our meals came I was thrilled with my perfectly seasoned kebabs with three kinds of meat - \u00a0chicken, lamb, and spiced ground beef, all of them cooked perfectly and all of them delicious. \u00a0The rice was not basmati, more like a pilaf, but was incredibly flavorful. \u00a0Alex said his Lebanese Chicken was amazing, but refused to share any with me.The owner brought us over a complimentary Turkish coffee, a lemonade, and a pistachio baklava - all amazing!!! \u00a0Isam also gave us a lesson in appreciating coffee. \u00a0He taught us how to sip it and about his secret ingredient (cardamom). \u00a0He grinds his own cardamom fresh from the seeds, which cost $100 per pound and I guarantee you are totally worth the expense. \u00a0He showed us both the seeds and the ground versions and let us smell them, pure heaven on Earth. \u00a0Isam says that the cardamom works on your nervous system to relax you; \u00a0I certainly felt relaxed when I left, but I think some of that might have to do with the owner's charm rather than the coffee. \u00a0When we left, we stopped up at the counter to say goodbye to our host, because it just felt more like a family visit than a restaurant visit. \u00a0You can just walk out of a restaurant, but you don't walk out on family without saying goodbye.I made a return visit several days later and not only did Isam remember me, but he came out from behind the counter to give me a hug and asked where my friend was (I had just dropped my coworker off at the airport). \u00a0I ordered the Lebanese Chicken and one of his heavenly lemonades. \u00a0Isam once again brought me a Turkish Coffee (this stuff is addicting) and a baklava to enjoy with it. \u00a0I enjoyed my second visit as much as my first; Isam gave me a menu and invited me to come back again during my visit. \u00a0He even gave me his phone number and told me to call if I needed anything. \u00a0I will definitely be back!!

The mixed dip appetizer is a work of art that includes all your favorites including dolmades to die for. My favorite is the fried smelts - which are cooked to perfection - but they are not available in every season. Everything with lamb is spectacular. The lamb meatballs have an intricate yet overwhelming taste that reminds me of that old saying...there are two kinds of people in the world, Greeks and those who want to be Greek.

The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy.

It has apparently not changed in that many years.I went on a Tuesday evening with a fiend of mine for what was to be a three hour long ordeal, not because we were having a laid back, relaxing dinner, but because the restaurant could not handle being \"slammed\" on a weeknight. The truth is that there was a group (who had made a reservation) and one other table when we walked in. Even when the group had gone and we were left there all on our own, the service was horrendous.The hummus was alright, but we were charged for the accompanying pita. I thought, given the price of the entrees, the pita could have been included.I ordered the swordfish and a friend ordered lamb, I think. They were out of both. I ended up with the salmon and she had the steak. While she enjoyed her steak, I feel like I could have had better salmon in my own kitchen. It was overly spiced, and drowned in sauce. There was no taste of salmon to be found.The desert was not as great as I remembered, but they sure are pretty. We had the galatabouriko, my favorite. We also chose a fig desert, which was a little grainy.The whole ordeal came to about $90 plus tip. Usually a good tipper, I left an appallingly low tip to make a point.Occupying the only table in the restaurant, we should have had better service. Toward the end it seemed like a joke. We stared at the owner and waiter waiting for the check, and then had to wait another twenty minutes for them to pick it up before we finally went up to the front to pay ourselves.I won't be back. I won't tell other people to go.The atmosphere was nice, but they seriously need to improve the quality of the food and the service before they can charge the amount they do.The two stars I left were for my friend's meal, the physical ambiance, and nostalgia, along with my hopes that the owner will read this review and improve the restaurant."], ["Georgia R.", "Holy mackarel! I can't believe no one has reviewed Greekfest yet!! \u00a0Greekfest is the best restaurant. It's not that easy to find and you'll probably drive past it once or twice before you spot it tucked back a little ways off of Camelback road. \u00a0The thing I love about this place is how authentic it is. You feel like you're really in Greece when you eat there, not Arizona and the food is as authentic as it gets. Try the Youvetsi, Cypriot Ravioli, shrimp souvlaki, tyropites, spanakopites and the feta cheese and olives- all are delicious! \u00a0It can get a little pricey, but it will be worth every bite!"], ["Fox H.", "The decor of Greekfest was great and really gave the feeling of being in a restaurant on one of the Greek islands. \u00a0We had the Spanakopites and Arnopites for appetizers and they were wonderful. \u00a0Then for dinner we had the Ravioli dish and the stuffed chicken breast dish and they too were out of this world. \u00a0Then for dessert, we had the Baklava which is a must for any Greek restaurant and Greekfest's Baklava was really really good. \u00a0Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to go back to try other dishes on the menu."], ["Robin L.", "I actually give this place 0 stars. food-wise, our meal was alright but service was pretty slow. after dinner we ordered tiramisu for dessert. after our server brought it out, we started to eat it, expecting it to be delicious, but no! the first thing we noticed was the disgusting bitter taste and then we took a closer look at the cake. right away we realized the cake was moldy! and I don't mean a little moldy - it was chock-FULL of green mold!!! of course we had already taken a bite because we were not expecting that, so we just started spitting it out like crazy, but could not manage to get the horrible taste out of our mouths. we told our server and he did not believe it at first so we insisted the cake was moldy. he took it away and brought us a fresh tiramisu, which we no longer had an appetite for. the owner came to talk to us when he casually apologized and did not offer to compensate by reducing any part of our bill. the only thing he did for us was give us some free biscotti, which we weren't the least bit interested in. on the bill we were charged for the full meal including the dessert. obviously NEVER going there again! and from now on when dining out we ALWAYS carefully inspect our food before taking the first bite!"], ["Megan D.", "I have known about this place for years, but just went for the first time last week as a default when we discovered that the Big Fat whatchamacallit place across the street had closed.

The food was spectacular, and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from (although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian, but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes). The array of desserts was to die for. My main complaint? Pricey like woah. And it was sneaky pricey. There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each, with a $9 appetizer, 3 desserts, cocktails, etc. and the bill was over $160!!! I thought my poor boyfriend was going to crap himself. \u00a0I honestly don't know how it got that expensive. The drinks? The desserts? Were the baskets of pita $8 apiece? I mean, a Greek meal costing \u00a0more than a steak extravaganza at Cork and Cleaver? Come on.

As a first time visitor, the order first, and seat yourself protocol was easy to figure out. I was anticipating an extended Greek menu, but the range of choices was limited to a few kabobs, gyros, soups and salads.We started off with a bowl of complimentary Lentil Soup. The soup was semi-thick, smooth, with a full-bodied lentil texture, and a subtle kick at the finisher. It was an outstanding soup, and I was already half way full prior to our appetizer. The Hummus ($4.99) was plentiful and served with warm pita. With garlic flavor in the backdrop, the texture was assisted by olive oil drizzles and easy to pick up with the basket of pita. The Chicken Kabob ($7.99) was served with two skewers of chicken and large portion of rice. The chicken was moist but a bit saltier than expected. The rice was flavorful, but also noticeably greasy. It was an experience of quantity over quality. Service was friendly, warm, attentive, and outstanding. We were pleasantly surprised by the free homemade Baklava at the end. With many restaurants that serve Kabobs and other conventional dishes in the area, I thought they could have distinguished themselves with a more traditional home-style menu filled with hard to find options. I don't think I will be coming back any time soon."], ["Heather Y.", "Stopped in here today for lunch with my boyfriend. I ordered the chicken kebab meal and he ordered a traditional gyro meal. The counter person offered us complimentary soup while we wait, so I had the lentil soup. The soup had nice spice and well cooked green lentils. My chicken kebabs we're AMAZING! They we're very juicy and had delicious seasoning. The rice with the meal was perfectly cooked and nicely spiced. The salad was fresh, although the dressing wasn't my favorite. I sampled my boyfriend's gyro, the meat had a nice oregano flavor and was tender. The pita bread tasted homemade, which is not too common and tastes so much better than premade. They also give pita bread with a garlic dip with meals which I thought was a nice touch.

Delicious as usual.

So tender, and seasoned wonderfully. I will definitely get that again. The rice is consistently cooked well - fluffy and light, and so flavorful.The best part of the dining in experience, is that Ninos usually let's us sample his daily soups. Tonight, there were 2 soups - Lentil soup, and Potato soup. \u00a0They each had such unique flavor, absolutely delicious. \u00a0The potato soup had a nice kick to it on the back end.

How is it, that it's only recently that I've come to enjoy it? I've only had one visit at AZ Kabob so far and was hesitant to write a review based on that one visit, but that visit was enough to lead me to believe that I've found myself a new favorite place. I first heard of AZ Kabob by skimming through Yelp for nearby restaurants. Thank you Yelpers! AZ Kabob had 92 reviews at the time with an average of 4-1/2 stars. A convincing rating! It was easy to locate it using the Google Maps app on my phone. Thank you modern technology! I walked in and was greeted with a very clean, modern layout. I already had a good idea of what I wanted to order prior to visiting and that was the Combination Platter, which included 1 skewer each of chicken, lamb, Koobideh (ground beef), and fillet. I was given the option of a side of rice or salad or half of each. I chose half of each. The dish also comes with warm, soft pita bread and rice. I ordered it as take-out and only had to wait somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes. I was also the only patron there at the time so that helps with the speed of preparation. I had the privilege of keeping this aromatic pleasure in my car with windows shut as I drove home. Needless to say I was very excited to experience the dish when I got home.AZ Kabob House is only the second Persian restaurant I've been to ever and the rice in both restaurants have had the best rice I've every had. This comes from someone whose been eating rice since probably since I was a baby. The rice is very fluffy. It looks like they add saffron and butter. All four skewers were so tender, warm, and full of flavor. I loved soaking up the juices at the bottom of the container and enjoyed 4 different flavors and textures of meat. The Combination Platter is supposed to feed 3 to 4 people. I would say that's accurate, but it was so good that I probably ate for two people. The only part of the dish that survived before the day was over was the salad. I'm definitely going to come back and am excited to try all the other dishes!"], ["Ali B.", "Well this was not what I expected from AZ Kabob house! Very pleasantly surprised! I was thinking it was going to be like skewers, the other Mediterranean place that used to be there, but it was definitely better!I loved the setup, the tables and lamps are adorable.

Same with the bathrooms, except that smelled strongly of bleach. My only real complaint.Lady working at the counter was awesome. She picked up on the fact that I'm a vegetarian and gave me suggestions. She recommended the pomegranate walnut stew which sounded great but I had just had a bunch of pomegranate at lunch so I decided maybe next time I would try it. I wanted to try a little bit of everything so I got the appetizer platter. It came with hummus, pita, vegetables, dolmas, and falafel. The hummus and falafel were the big winners here, but I totally could have used some tzatziki to dip the falafel in. I will for sure order some next time. The falafel had a good crisp texture and yummy flavor. The hummus was smooth and tasted excellent with everything on the platter. Pita bread was tasty too! I wasn't a huge fan of the dolmas and I totally burned my tongue on one which was annoying haha. My mom got a chicken skewer and loved it. I tried the rice it came with and it was very yummy!

Rice was spot on as well (not soggy, not under cooked... just perfect amount of chew).The baklava was fine, but I'm biased... I make the world's best baklava (hint: it requires enough butter to kill a small family) but given how biased I am, I thought it was good enough to order a tray from them and not make it myself so that counts for something.Besides eating here again, we fully expect to use them again to cater other events in the future.

Pretty much every food trend over the past 5 years or so has its epicenter in LA. From Korean style frozen yogurt to cupcakes and now food trucks, the people of LA know a good thing when they taste it. While all of these trends have some how made their way to the Valley of the Sun, there's one thing that I've never been able to find here, garlic sauce like the one that's served at the LA institution Zankou Chicken. \u00a0If you've heard of Zankou and its amazing Lebanese chicken and tangy fluffy garlic sauce you know exactly what I mean when I say it's ethereal. For those who've never tried it either pack an overnight bag and head to LA or drive down to 20th Street and Van Buren to Al-Hana inside of Baiz market, its the closest thing to Zankou Chicken in Phoenix and its close location makes it even better.The area located around Baiz Market might seem a little rough around the edges but the market itself is clean, well lit and packed with all sorts of interesting Middle Eastern grocery items from dairy and fresh produce to meat and hookah paraphernalia. Tucked in the corner of the market is Al-Hana, a postage stamp sized restaurant specializing in, you guessed it Middle Eastern cooking. While the offerings might seem typical the flavors are bold and shouldn't be missed. The creamy roasted eggplant dip Babaghannuj ($4.49) had a smokiness usually not found in many other places. Al-Hana leaves their version thick and chunky with just the right amount of olive oil drizzled over the top. Ordering the Falafel Plate ($5.99) will get you 6 deep fried cumin scented pucks of ground chickpeas and fava beans. Pile a couple of these onto a freshly baked pita, slather with tahini and enjoy the crunch. Id also highly recommend the Labneh Pie ($2.99) which is filled with labneh, a Lebanese cream cheese, onions and tomatoes all baked in a light tender crust. The main dish for me was of course the Whole Roasted Chicken ($9.99). It comes with pita, pickles and garlic sauce. The chicken itself is so well seasoned and juicy it would seem like a crime to adorn it with anything until you get some garlic sauce on it. The texture is light and fluffy, almost like a garlicky mayonnaise. After one taste you might ask them for another container, seriously delicious. After a wonderful meal you'd think there wouldn't be enough room left for desert, but my rule is there's always room. With that I sauntered to the back of Baiz Market where their in store bakery is located, most of the case filled delights are around $2 each including a flaky syrup soaked baklava.

Most other items went up by $1 to $1.50For that price the falafel is rather small and does not include any sides.I still like the overall quality and taste of the food but the value factor bottomed out with this one move.One a positive note we finally found a can of hummus on the grocery side that is good, and the fresh bags of pita are still .99 so you can still have a ton of pita and humus for $2.50 or less."], ["Jeremy P.", "Lebanese food is one of my favorite cuisines. \u00a0Having heard about this combined market/restaurant, and seen it on Howard Seftel's list of top Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, I decided to check this place out. \u00a0I couldn't decide whether it sounded more like a Haji Baba or Cafe Istanbul type place.Upon entering the facility, it became clear that this place is much more market than the aforementioned establishments. \u00a0It's basically a grocery store, with a little corner cordoned off for the restaurant. \u00a0There is no table service; you order at the counter. \u00a0The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pies (I may have to venture into this territory; it's something Cafe Istanbul and Haji Baba don't have), plates, and sandwiches.I was disappointed to find that they don't have lamb tongue, and that they were out of soujouk and ma'anek. \u00a0I went with the lamb sandwich, which didn't have the lamb in kabab form like you would expect, but rather as a ground-up kafta type of consistency.The sandwiches weren't huge, but I will say, that lamb was nicely flavored. \u00a0And my dining companion mentioned that the beef shawarma was pretty tasty as well. \u00a0The food really is pretty good.Cafe Istanbul still has this place beat. \u00a0This is true when it comes to food, but even more so when it comes to ambiance. \u00a0But it's nice that there is a respectable place to get Middle Eastern food in downtown Phoenix."], ["Michael A.", "Little no frills cafe integrated with a small international market.

Great to pass the time looking around while you wait for your food"], ["Tim J.", "Rather than continuing to repeat what is said in the other reviews, if you like Middle Eastern food, you'll love Al-Hana.It is fresh - made on the spot with Halal meats and fresh produce, the breads, wraps and pies all made from scratch and cooked there.It is inexpensive - the little pies start at 69 cents and most of the sandwiches are under $5. You can easily feed two for about $10.And it is good - all the fresh, homemade ingredients really come through in the flavors and textures, tasty meat, warm bread, crisp, fresh produce.I am definitely going to make eating at Al-Hana a habit. It sure beats the alternative of corporate chain restaurants, processed ingredients and assembly line packaged food."], ["Christine J.", "I tend to forget about Middle Eastern food when I'm considering my dining options, but I have to thank Jason W - who invited me to try this little lunch spot in the Baiz Market - for reminding me of how satisfying and delicious (and in this case, affordable!) it can be. I met him and some other Yelpers to sample some of Al-Hana's wares and while there were a few strike-outs (specifically, the hummus, which didn't have enough garlic or lemon, and the tabloulleh, which had way too much parsley), the falafel sandwich, shwarma beef and chicken sandwiches (both with garlic sauce), and cheese pies were all so flavorful! And at $2.99 and $3.99 for the sandwiches and $.50 - $3.99 for the other sides, the lunch was also incredibly affordable. If you are ever in the area or work or live nearby, you should definitely check Al-Hana out. Given how affordable it is, you can have a savory and enjoyable lunch that really fills you up. If you have time after you finish eating, definitely take a few minutes to walk around the market - there are some real deals on Mediterranean staples, like 2-lb bags of dates for $3.99! One final note - there is a $10 minimum for debit/credit card usage, so bring cash."], ["Brian T.", "What a gem!!!!

If you approach Al Hana with a traveler's sense of wonder, however, this establishment is very cool. \u00a0The market is fascinating, especially the tiny bakery and butcher area in the back. The restaurant is more of a simple counter, no frills and limited menu, but rates an objective five stars based on food quality, value and service. \u00a0Delicious, cheap, and the young lady who helped us was very nice. \u00a0I dont need a sorbet course to give it five stars.

During a bi-annual allergy induced laryngitis, I went in search for my favorite tea- dry desert lime. Apparently, I am the only one in PHX who knows it because no one is carrying it this year. Next best thing? Find dried limes. This quest led me to Biaz Market. The neighborhood it is in is rough, but it's more poverty than unsafe. The parking lot, though, was full. Walking in I decided to spend some time wandering the aisles. Within 30 seconds I was blown away. They have rose water and orange blossom water for 99 cents! The only place I had found it before sells it for $4! Fresh produce, cheeses, meats. Fresh herbs that I can't find elsewhere for only 89 cents! What? Am I dreaming? An entire aisle of spices- so many that I missed my limes I originally came here for. The very, very nice employee didn't just tell me what aisle, she walked me straight to it and when I commented about a ground version, she helped me search for that. Dolmas in cans and jars for under $3 (and they're freaking delicious!). Pita bread 50 cents. So much yummy stuff priced so well. We don't often get such gems of ethnicity in Phoenix, but this hidden treasure made me feel sooooooo good on a sick day.

First, the menu is very hard to understand (see the pic that someone posted). I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter. There isn't much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge. For soda, all they had was the cans and they charged $1.00 for them. Later, while I was eating I noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market, then coming over to order their food (pain in the ass if you ask me). Anyhow, so I was only 1 of a few people there and the food took quite a while. When they finally called my order I went up and asked for the \"garlic sauce\" that I heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost $1.00. I said nevermind because I wasn't going to pay that for a small container of condiment! I was surprised at how small the sandwich was. It wasn't \u00a0impressive either. Just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of \u00a0chicken, a few tomato slices, lettuce, and a little sauce. In my opinion this wasn't worth 3.99, but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was.The hummus was good, but \u00a0nothing spectacular. This place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing...literally right across the street.

It was $25 for Chicken kebab, Kafta kebab, gyro, rice, hummus, babbaganoush, falafel, dolma, spinach pies, meat pies and salad or soup. The only thing I didn' t like was the spinach pie, everything else was great. My favorite was the kafta kebab, although it did taste exactly like a good meatloaf (which I like, but not sure it's what I expected).

The food is mediocre at best and out of a can at worst. I had the mixed vegetarian plate (my standard to get an idea of the food at any new middle eastern place) and C got the gyro sandwich. The grape leaves were absolutely out of a can (and microwaved to the point of scalding) and I'm guessing the same applies for the hummus and baba. Gyro meat was not fresh sliced off of a spit - it was totally uniform slices, all the same exact shape that had probably been microwaved. Clearly out of a package and not of the spit.

Lord I miss that man!!!So yeah there isn't much of an atmosphere, the pictures don't really fit in the molding that was hung to frame art, but does that effect the food? Absolutely not! Physically, not much has changed since this place was the Green Leaf Cafe which was the predecessor to the Persian Garden. Except that the food here is less on the fusion side of Mediterranean flavors and more middle-eastern authentic Iraqis with a little Jordanian thrown in.I love that you start out with the green lentil soup or salad with every meal. The name of the restaurant actually comes from said salad, which is a mix of romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, mint and toasted triangles of pita bread, covered with a tart balsamic vinegar dressing. But the soup is where it's at. It's unlike your average lentil soup - smooth and creamy, with bits of pasta. Very mild. It's a nice homey touch which is really what this food is all about. And that homey touch comes naturally, as the two main staffers are brother and sister. Their mom often helps out in the kitchen (and dad is busy cooking in Scottsdale).When we arrived there were just two tables with guests, so we had our pick of eating spots. And there were a steady stream of people coming in for take-out throughout our visit. The menu is actually quite large considering their kitchen is about the size of my bathroom. On this visit, my sis and I decided to sample as much as we could to get a feel for the place. She was a little iffy as she had never had this kind of food, but once the dishes started rolling out, she quickly became a fan. We started with the fava beans, mixed with olive oil, garlic, and lemon. Main courses consisted of the Falafel Plate which comes with warm pita, hummus, pickles, and tomatoes and Chicken Shwarmas which were spiced perfectly and had juicy - dare I say succulent chicken. We topped the meal off with some freshly made baklava and rolled our way out to the car for our trip home.Just after the soup course, a large Ford taxi pulled up and out of it piled out 8 full grown (some more fully grown if you get my drift, than others) ME men. It was sort of like the proverbial clown car... I mean seriously I didn't know you could get that many men in one car. They headed straight for the table next to us and then things really started to pick up. Four of them ordered Lamb Kuzi and the rest all got something different. Let me just say that my sister had to hold me down because their food all looked so good. Their table was literally crammed full of dishes with smells so good that I swear my nose grew just trying to get a better whiff!Our meal came to $25 \u00a0but in retrospect, we really didn't need all three dishes and could have easily gotten out of there for about $16. Service was attentive, food was phenomenal (and healthy - how often do you find that?!!), and it's only .5 miles from my house. This is probably the best ME food that I've had at a local restaurant and the place would definately warrant the coveted 5-stars on the food alone, but the afore mentioned atmosphere knocks it down one. It may have taken me years to get over to Fattoush, but it won't be long before my next visit! That Kuzi is calling me!!!"], ["Melissa B.", "I used to work at a Lebanese restaurant/bar for years. \u00a0And...I'm from Michigan which gives me a fair position to judge Middle Eastern food, as Michigan is crawling with homemade pita and baba to die for..This place is not about gyros or belly dancers, it's a real deal Middle Eastern deli. \u00a0I agree fully with the average 4 star rating losing one star ONLY for lack of atmosphere. \u00a0But, if you are craving falafel, warm pita, hummus, or chicken schwarma for lunch than this is your place. \u00a0Nothing on the menu will disappoint!"]], "ZK Grill": [["Emily K.", "Good food, friendly service, clean.

This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!!  How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!! I truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!! Way to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!! :) I look forward to coming here more often!!"], ["Rez A.", "Great quality , fresh Persian food , great kababs! \u00a0The chef here knows how to make every dish on their menu perfect."], ["Rob D.", "Gone way down recently. Sunday night 6:30, tried to order takeout on the phone, they said machine down cant order, call back in a few minutes. So I called 5 more times while I drove there. On the 5th call I finally got through, same response machine broke. So I show up and order ( only 3 workers two cooks and a very young cashier). So he writes order on scrap of paper (why couldn't he do this over the phone) and asks if I can pay in cash ( cause the machine is down) so now I am waiting, what do I do, write this review. My 3rd visit here in 2014 the other 2 would have been rated only 3 of 5. \u00a0Like I said they have gone way down recently."]], "Athens Bar & Grill": [["Evan W.", "This place is a midtown hidden gem. No idea how we haven't found it before, but we will most certainly be back! Excellent food, service and venue. Wonderful experience! Top food pick: house salad with signature Mediterranean dressing. Phenomenal."], ["Josh A.", "A hilarious endeavor in the Greek experience.While the dirty floors, tables, and walls are a nice touch to add a third world feel, I'm pretty sure the health inspector wouldn't appreciate the attempt.The hummus tastes like an old divorce and the tzaziki is runny and depressing.But at least the AC is broken and it's hot and muggy, just like a summer day in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea."], ["Jennifer O.", "It's always a little uncomfortable to be the naysayer in a sea of ... yay... sayers? Heh. Anyway, I think maybe the problem is that I came to Athens for dinner... on a weekend... and this place is more like a lunch place possibly. The place was completely empty, which maybe should have been a warning. My friend and I had decided to come here because we could get food and it was also a bar ( hence the name bar and grill). Well, the bar is more like the bar one would have in their home... there are a few bottles of alcohol there, but a bar that does not make. So cocktails were (sadly) not had. We did, against our better judgment, get some food. I had a chicken pita and we shared some greek fries. The fries were alright, just fries with some feta on top essentially. I know the owner ( or whoever was there) made them fresh, so that was a plus. The pita was fairly lackluster. The sauce on it was flavorless and the chicken was underseasoned. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I would want to eat again either. Besides the mediocre food, we were very disappointed by the lackluster service. Like I said, we were the only ones there, but we waited a long time for any drink refills and for our check. The guy who works there (or owns the place) was sitting at his little desk by the kitchen ignoring us most of the time, which I totally get, since having one table is probably excruciatingly boring, but being that they decided to be open for dinner, they should treat it like it's actually business hours. I probably won't be back."], ["Natalie T.", "Very awesome experience eating here tonight. \u00a0 The owner Tomas was a delight to talk to, \u00a0and the food was wonderful. \u00a0 We'll definitely be back again!"], ["Rina H.", "I had previously came into this restaurant once two years ago and didn't eat here because the workers were not welcoming. I had been given a deal to try this place so I decided to give them another chance. I walk in and was not greeted by anyone even tho the workers were sitting down by the minibar I immediately realized their terrible customer service, which is probably why they are resorting to deals to attempt to boost customers. Well I hope the business is reading this because if your business sucks it doesn't matter how many deals you put out there, people will come once and then never return. The waitress did not take responsibility for her actions and kept blaming each situation she couldn't accommodate on \"him\" which I'm assuming is her boss. \"Can I get some lemon with my water\" \"sorry HE is out of lemons\" \"can I take this to go?\" \"Sorry HE said you can't\" etc. I found that rather weird. I asked for a gyro plate for here and a chicken plate to go and was told \"he\" can't pack one to go so I said that was fine I'll just get both for here and take the leftovers. (Same thing) well I found it rather strange that you are a restaurant with no to go boxes... Then after a few minutes they said \"they were willing to pack it to go and make an exception\". Like all of a sudden to go boxes magically appeared! Well I didn't wanna piss them off anymore so I said no it's fine I'll get both plates for here and take the leftovers like they wanted. Some other minor things that added up were that I asked for a fork and knife and she only gave me a fork, and I asked for no onions on my plates in which there were obvious pieces of onions on the plate. This place just crawls with bad things. I highly suggest DO NOT COME HERE!! Service sucks and food is not good enough to ignore that!This is the strangest restaurant ive ever ate at. I don't understand their practices and don't trust their owner or food after giving this restaurant two chances. This place makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and unwelcomed. The food was ok and definitely not tasty enough for me to return. The gyro meat was too salty and the chicken meat was flavorless. And I'm not just saying that because the service here sucks."], ["Pablo M.", "Great gyros, the cook/owner is very friendly and will accomodate to you within reason. I prefer my gyros without lettuce and extra onion, he always says \"you got it, buddy!\" The food is always tasty and the meat is perfectly spiced. I highly recommended this place.I have only gotten things to go, the dining room itself is spacious, clean and a luxurious feel to it. \u00a0They have Karaoke according to signage."], ["Matt H.", "Great Food... Just had the Gyro combo and one of the best Gyros I've ever had. Definitely recommend this place!"], ["Noor B.", "Reallllllllly good. Definitely enjoyed my meal here.Gyro is yummy with a reasonable price and some nice options if you don't want to get fries and a drink (like double meat at an extra charge). Chicken shawarma is served on a bed of fluffy rice. Definitely enjoyed it. Baklava - awesome. So delicious.Location can be hard to find, but it's a good, solid gyro shop in Central Phoenix. I will be back."], ["Carmen L.", "My co-worker and I tried this lil joint today for the first time. The ambiance... amazingly charming. Food was great. I am definitely a fan. I tried their greek coffee... love it. The best part of the experience was service with a smile and some cheerful banter. I loved it. Check it out."], ["Roger E.", "I spent half my life eating food in New York and needless to say I am extremely picky ... I have never had a better Greek meal in my life ... Oh did I also mention that my mom's maiden name is Staros ... OPA ... They also have live music at noon for lunch can you imagine! Tomas may you have a great success in your restaurant fabulous! :-)"], ["Rock R.", "While it might be off the beaten path, this place has the best gyro I've found in Phoenix. I normally don't take the time to write reviews, but I couldn't recommend this place more. For the price, the gyro combo is well worth $7, and it's an added bonus that the owner is both Greek and incredibly passionate about his food."], ["Steve K.", "Stopped in for lunch today and to check the place out. It's a bit tricky to find in this small strip center as it doesn't face the street. \u00a0It's a small local business owned by a very friendly Lebanese man names Tom (Tomas). \u00a0It's a fun little place to hang out and listen to music, and they even have a small stage in the corner. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma for lunch, to go. Took about ten minutes, but worth the wait as everything was fresh and flavorful. Can't wait to go back though and try a gyro as they are my favorite."], ["Kalyan R.", "Horrible service time on a to go order.

They may have been understaffed because we really waited ages for everything. Food was alright."], ["Reimun S.", "I like it! The food and service is really good! I love to support small businesses like this that are family owned and operated. They feature many of the authentic Mediterranean Items including beef kabob, chicken Kabob, Shawarma, etc. They also feature live entertainment during the weekend I believe. Definitely stop by when you're in the area! I would recommend it!!!"], ["Brittanie M.", "Really hard to find if you're heading east! Just turn on 9th Street and it'll be in the dingy shopping center on the west side of the street (near an \"Indian\" fry bread place I also want to try). Having had gyros at a different place earlier in the week, I had something to compare this to (before that, it'd been over 10 years!). These gyros are a little smaller but a lot fresher and tastier. The meat was seasoned perfectly and you could taste it through the fresh tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce. I don't mind a little bit of grease because that tells you the meat is fresh and roasted rather than pre-cooked and stored. It also came with really delicious french fries. The hummus was obviously in-house and came with a pita that was steamed so it was very soft and warm. I took it to go and it smelled so good, I almost snuck some on the way home! The gyro and fries came with a canned soda and was $5.99. The hummus was just under $5. A very tasty, filling meal with drink for under $13 with tax is definitely a win! Definitely surprised and sad this place wasn't packed on a Friday night around 4. I hope people are just getting take-out because this place deserves to stick around.I will be back!"], ["Alexandria K.", "We stumbled upon this place on Indian School. There was no wait, service was fast and great. The gyro sandwich was delicious and fresh. It is a little hole in the wall place, with middle eastern decor but also tropical beaded curtains and pictures of black and white pin-up girls. Definitely recommend."], ["Heather Y.", "A little disappointed they didn't have a chicken gyro, but the chicken pita was pretty good. I enjoyed the creamy flavor of the taziki sauce and the oregano infused salad dressing. Side salad was nice and fresh.
