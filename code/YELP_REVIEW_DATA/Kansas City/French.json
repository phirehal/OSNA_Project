It is always outstanding and the service is excellent. I have been for brunch twice and wine and dessert once and I plan on being a repeat customer. Firstly, the atmosphere. Westport Cafe and Bar feels like a hipster french bistro and is unlike most places in KC. It almost feels like you've just walked into a trendy cafe in New York City or Paris. The bar is fully stocked and WCB has several signature cocktails (Bloody Mary, mimosa, Bellini) that come with your brunch order.The food has always been top notch. I'm partial to their brioche french toast and nova scotia benedict but I'd assume that everything is good. They make their own English muffins, they top the brioche with honey lavender cream.. it just doesn't get much better. I also have never waited long for food.

While we were eating there were two other tables with patrons. After they left the staff decided to turn the lights of the restaurant off leaving the bar lights is the only lights in the restaurant. \u00a0The service to this point has been pretty good.

I was pleasantly surprise by the casual atmosphere and cheerful staff. The bartender greeted me immediately, found me a place at the bar and was attentive the whole evening. First off, I tried the Aviation ($8) which is a tricky drink since it combines Gin, Maraschino, Creme de Violette and lemon. Many times it comes out tasting like potpourri but he made it perfectly! Next, I tried the Martinez ($8); Old Tom Gin, Dolin Rouge, Maraschino and Bitters. Once again, a solidly crafted drink.Since the place was so inviting, I stayed for their \"Reverse Happy Hour\" (10pm-close) and got to try their Spring Pea Ravioli in Lemon Brown Butter and the Chicken Liver Pat\u00e9. Both were $5 for the happy hour. The ravioli was delicious, though the sauce was actually a buerre blanc vs. brown butter (still very tasty). The chicken liver was good. It was smooth, mild flavored and came with baguette, pickled onion, grain mustard and pickles. Portion wise it was definitely enough for two to share.Overall, this place is a good value, casual neighborhood dining spot that I would absolutely visit again."], ["Daniela G.", "This was the first restaurant that the boy and I tried when we first moved to KC a little over a year ago and ever since then we've had an ongoing relationship. \u00a0We've been to WCB multiple times and I have yet to have a bad meal, a bad drink, bad service or bad anything for that matter. \u00a0The food is always delicious and the drinks are fantastic! \u00a0The service is spot on! \u00a0We once took the boy's family for a birthday dinner and they didn't even blink at the fact that we were a table of 10 on a Saturday night. \u00a0French food can get a little heavy and the atmosphere can be a little stuffy, but here you never feel uncomfortable nor do you regret anything you've eaten. \u00a0WCB are in it for the long haul - this relationship is one to stand the test of time - this is real love!Favs: The first time we went there was a Milanese on the menu that was so delicious i dreamt about it for days, but I haven't seen it on the menu back, might have to start a petition. \u00a0Other than that the poisson meuniere is ahhhmazing, and we always start with either the cheese plate or the baked ricotta w/ goat cheese and truffled honey, both to die for!"], ["Karen L.", "Super loud place.

Expertly balanced. One of the best I've had anywhere in Kansas City.WC&B Fall and Oates - Theres nothing not to like about this drink and the name only makes it a little better. If only it would sing to me as I drink it.WC&B Brothers Keeper - Whew this one will put some fire to your breath. I'm not sure if the barkeep simply used more of the rye in this one than the Old Fashioned but this one didn't seem to be executed quite as smoothly.WC&B Charlie Sour - Don't be fooled by the cute glassware, this is a great drink. The Earl Grey infused bourbon has a really unique taste but isn't terribly over powering. Great balance and flavor here and probably my favorite of the bunch.WC&B Winter Smash - I actually wish it was even colder outside on the day I enjoyed this one. Buffalo Trace can be a tricky one to mix with from time to time but WC&B works with it well here. A success for sure.As mentioned above, I also enjoyed their mussels as well which were absolutely delicious. They were definitely not overly salty as other reviewers have mentioned so hopefully those are just isolated incidents. I may have stolen a fry or two off a friend's plate and those were quite good as well. The service however... VERY disappointing. Our waitress made herself available every 20 minutes or so which we felt, was not an appropriate frequency at all. It was not overly busy but I suppose perhaps they were understaffed at the time. With how few people were in the establishment, we couldn't figure out where she was disappearing. We just started making personal trips to the bar to get waters refilled. She also missed orders but seemed to be very expeditious when we asked for our tickets.

As the night went on the noise levelreduced, and eventually we were the last ones at the restaurant. The house red wine was very delicious: subtle, slightly sweet, and unpretentious. I ordered the poulet roti, which was a tad bit disappointing: although the chicken portion was very generous, the sauce was very salty, and there was a disproportionate amount of mashed potatoes (trending to the smaller side of an appropriately sized portion). When it came to dessert, I ordered the chocolate lava cake. The menu states to wait an additional 12 minutes for the lava cake to arrive, thereby increasing the anticipation of the dish. However my expectations were not met. When I hear \"lava\", I figure there would be molten chocolate oozing from the center of the cake; not so. Instead, the cake was more like a soft fudge cake. The cake tasted delicious, especially with the included berries, but I cannot shake the feeling of disappointment. Especially since I had to wait 12 minutes for the cake to be delivered. The staff, however,was very good: attentive, polite, and prompt. Did I have a good evening? Yes. Could the experience have been more enjoyable? I believe so. Will I give this place another chance?

That's a ton of waiting for two simple brunch time meals. As for the food, it's average. I might be spoiled considering I've spent some time in France, but this was average at best. My girlfriend and I had the salmon omelette and the Farm Table with a side of grilled ham. The Salmon Omelette was mediocre in flavor but large in quantity. The Farm Table was overpowered by the obnoxious amount of goats cheese. It could have used half the cheese and triple the mushrooms. Like the service, it was very unbalanced.

I overheard the bartender mention this was her first day... while that explains why those beverages took about 4x as long as they should have, it doesn't explain why management wouldn't have prepared more thoroughly for business. \u00a0I also remember dining with a large party several years ago and they didn't have our table ready when we arrived, despite our reservation. At very least that deserves an explanation, of which we received none while we piled into the small bar area, waiting to be seated. It has never offended me terribly, but I just cannot give more than three stars to an establishment who has made such missteps on the basics, in multiple visits."]], "Tatsu's French Restaurant": [], "The Capital Grille": [], "Avenues Bistro": [], "iPhoTower": [], "Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurants": [], "iPho Tower": [], "Sasha's Baking Co": [], "Le Fou Frog": [], "French Market": [], "Harry's Country Club": [["Elton M.", "As someone that has worked in the river market for years I love this place.

Today I had beautiful food at Harry's. Go figure.This place has something for everyone. Today I had a most beautiful Greek salad. It had cruchy romaine, grape tomatoes, artichoke hearts, black olives and feta cheese all tossed in a light lemony vinagarette. All around the outside were grilled pita triangles. WHY did I not think to take a picture of this salad? I will try to be better about photos because you need to see this work of art. Besides being beautiful it was very, very tasty!Let the record show that I am addicted to the damn french fries at Harry's. On my many visits I have tried (and liked) burgers, chicken sandwiches, tuna melt, patty melt, chicken salad sandwich, enchiladas, great appetizers, cocktails and live entertainment occassionally. The Waldorf salad is Way up on the preferred food list, too. See...almost everything I order comes with the damn good fries. You can eat healthy or not so healthy. It's all good.In addition to the food I have to give this place mucho kudos for their variety and service. I like the atmosphere at this place because it's an 'everyone' kind of place. Today I sat next to a large, very tatt-ed KCMO police officer. I did not cause a rukus.Get to Harry's and try the special Greek salad or one of your favorite foods prepared the Harry's way."], ["Lauren H.", "Great bar and grill or pub food, but I wish they had more of a selection. Also the beers are a lot overpriced compared to other similar restaurants in the area. I would definitely recommend the homemade chips and dip though, I could eat them all the time!"], ["Ashley D.", "This is my favorite lunch/laid back dinner spot. Great patio. Great food. The tres tacos are incredible. Food comes out fast if you're in a hurry (e.g., pre-concert dining), but be sure to ask for the check if you need it quickly. Otherwise, they try not to rush you and you may wait awhile to get it. I often take friends and family who visit from out-of-town to Harry's, and have never gotten any complaints. Killer moscow mules (they make their own ginger ale!), great beer selection, and just tried the homemade limeade today and loved it."], ["Courtney L.", "I was skeptical when Harry's was chosen as my team's happy hour because I've read the other reviews, but we had a great time and the service was just fine! We went on a Thursday during happy hour and arrived early (right at 4), so we had no problems grabbing a table and some attention from a waiter right away. I thought I would start with their homemade shandy.. and I did. It was also the only thing I drank all night because it was fantastic!! Not overly sweet, but it definitely had a kick. After 3 glasses, I had to call it quits or I was never going to be able to drive home! My co-workers were downing the Missouri Mules like they were going dry. I'm not a big whiskey fan, so I passed, but they were a great twist without the copper glass and a big hit with the group. I also ordered the homemade chips and french onion dip. LOVED this. I devoured the generous portion mostly by myself. I'm a french onion dip fiend and this didn't disappoint. I also had a ton of dip leftover after I polished off the chips, so they didn't skimp! I'll definitely come back here, but will be weary of coming on the weekend. Loved the homemade shandy and can't wait to have more of it!"], ["Tyler B.", "Best bar in Kansas City. Huge selection. Solid bar staff who know more than a thing or two about how to pour a drink. Strongly recommend the Moscow Mule or any scotch recommendation from the bar. Atmosphere is welcoming for a single drink or a night out with friends."], ["Rosa O.", "Had a good time here the other night, especially appreciating the live music on the patio. Was a little disappointed at the idea of a cover charge in a place like this, but it was worth it. They were very accommodating to the large numbers of us that migrated here as part of a wedding after party, but put their foot down when they closed, and kicked people out pretty promptly. I was fine with it, but it was definitely not what I was used to. Decent drinks, decent prices, nice atmosphere."], ["Morgan K.", "I like Harry's. I really do. The food is good, sometimes a little guilt-causing and indulgent (gotta love the fried food). Their house drinks are great on a summer evening with a group of friends and the patio is one of my favorites in town.I just wish the staff was a little more friendly. They are not outwardly rude, by any means, but sometimes they're not outwardly nice either. Everytime I'm there, I'm with a group of friends on the patio so my outing is never truly ruined. But everytime, the servers are a little on the under-attentive side.That being said, I'll go back to the good stuff. The house drinks - haven't had a bad one yet and the nachos are excellent."], ["Kevin S.", "The appearance of a dive bar but the staff is friendly, the beer selection extensive, and the food a cut above the casual dining segment."], ["Derek H.", "Update to \"Meh.\"Came on Snake Saturday afternoon. \u00a0Sat down around 1:30, after the lunch crowd. \u00a0It took Party of 5 people and it took 40 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered it. \u00a0The real frustrating part is we all ordered Tacos and Club sandwiches. \u00a0How in the world does it take 40 minutes to make tacos and sandwiches?It doesn't. \u00a0Our plates had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, judging by how scalding hot they were. \u00a0We were a little parched from the parade festivities and our glasses were pretty dry for the most part.Food was as good as usual. \u00a0I'm just afraid we might have gotten a new waiter or caught them at a shift change or while there wasn't any manager on duty.Two Words: FRIED TACOS.I LOVE fried tacos and theirs do not disappoint. \u00a0The food quality has always been good and the service not too bad."], ["Julie K.", "No service, waited a bit and still no service. Thumbs down. So what can I say, no service no business."], ["Zach G.", "OK, I have given Harry's another try. At first, I liked the place, but my most recent experience had me questioning if I would ever be willing to go back. However, I found myself in the area, and m'lady and I decided we would give it one more shot. Granted, the place was very quiet (about 6pm on a Tuesday), but the experience was much, much better.For one, our server actually acknowledged our existence. That alone made her worlds better than the nightmare of a guy we had last night. I definitely appreciate my existence being at least noted. She was very efficient, but not a pain in the butt. My drink came out quick and was poured pretty well for $4.25 or so during happy hour. We also ordered some food - a Pork Tenderloin sandwich, which was $6.95 or so off of the happy hour menu, and a Cuban sandwich, which was not on the happy hour menu. The food came out pretty quick. Much better than the 84 hours last night (I only slightly round up to that number...). The great thing? It was clear the food came out right after it was cooked, not after 30 minutes under a heat lamp. Success! What does that mean? Well, for one, the sandwich bread wasn't disgustingly soggy, nor the fries cold.The pork tenderloin, in fact, was almost too hot to eat at first. Beyond that, it was just a normal p.t. sandwich - big, fried, unhealthy, and decent. The Cuban sandwich was much, much better than last time - much more meat, much tastier meat, and actually hot. It was pretty good...not the best Cuban, but pretty good.So, I will now actually be back here. I still think this place is best for drinks, but the food as won my SLIGHT approval again. As long as I don't have to suffer through the guy from last time..."], ["Chris G.", "Holy smokes, am I the last of my Yelper friends to review?

In their own words, Harry's is \"A reverent take on a 1940s honky-tonk roadhouse\", and that is exactly what it is. I love everything about this restaurant; the vibe here is part old-fashioned southern country club, part western honky-tonk. Harry's is a perfect combination of a modern, hip vibe and the charm and swankiness of post-World War II Americana. You know that the owner has a deep appreciation for the country music legends of yesteryear; the decor and interior design is a spectacular but tasteful panoply of memorabilia from American music's heyday. Rather than feeling nostalgia for such talented musicians and a time gone by, there's an eerie sensation that at any moment Hank Williams will walk through the door and take a seat at the bar. That being said, of course Harry's wouldn't be complete without its famed jukebox replete with country western classics and rockabilly favorites. The song selections are not contrived, however, but are a purist's delight.I've wanted to bring my mother here for dinner for some time, so I was excited when I saw that Harry's would be participating in Restaurant Week. To complete our small dinner party, my aunt and uncle also joined us after hearing so much about it from me. The special menu offered for Restaurant Week included three courses for only $15. Each dish was a sampling of the extensive fare available at Harry's Country Club, which offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner.For starters, I chose the Tomato Basil Soup, which was quite good, rich and creamy, and the perfect first course. For our entree, my mother and I selected the Bowtie Pasta with Basil & Cream which came with grilled chicken and was made with asparagus, green peas, and plum tomatoes. The portion was large and very filling, and the chicken was just right: seared and seasoned on the outside, and perfectly cooked. My aunt and uncle had the Yucatan Shrimp for their entree and raved that the sweet and sour shrimp was succulent with a kick of heat. For dessert, I savored the decadent Chocolate Torte. It was melt-in-your-mouth goodness, although I also found myself eying my family's huge slices of Carrot Cake. They assured me it was as good as it looked, and I don't even normally like carrot cake!Overall, we had a very pleasant experience, and I know that we all will be returning. My husband and I enjoy coming here in the evening to hear our favorite bands play on their large and inviting patio. Unlike some night clubs or bars in KC, Harry's is quiet, calm, and relaxed in comparison, while at the same time providing you with entertainment and an escape from the cares of the world. Harry's is also well known for its well-stocked bar and extensive drink menu. They offer top-notch and unusual craft beers from around the world as well as your favorite cocktails.

Harry's was one of the new places that we tried, and it was definitely A-OK, even if we were there for the sad (for us) occasion of Joi's farewell! Harry's certainly has an old-time saloon feeling to it, especially with the large pin-up style painting over the bar - it's totally something you'd expect to have seen in Tombstone, AZ back in the 1800s. Couple that with the creaky wood floors and the comforting yellowish lighting, and you feel like you've stepped back in time. And I'm totally cool with that! We weren't exactly sure where the group was when we got to Harry's, so we ordered a drink at the bar before scouting everything out. The bartenders were quick and friendly, and while the drinks certainly weren't cheap, they weren't horribly expensive either. The outside enclosed patio was nice enough, and I hear the proper outdoors patio area is even better, when the weather cooperates! The table service out there was a bit slow, but \u00a0in fairness, she did have a large group of us to contend with. We didn't have any food, as we were on our way to dinner, but the chips and dip seemed to be a big hit, as were the burgers. I'm glad we finally made it to Harry's, as I had been hearing about it for ages, and I could see stopping in for a drink from time to time, though I'd probably be most content sitting at the bar."], ["Emily S.", "Looking for somewhere new one Friday evening we decided to skip the usual places and head to Harry's. It looked like we weren't the only ones! Despite the cold February winds mixed with winter-y drizzle the place was PACKED! Luckily there were only two of us so we were seated right away. The happy hour menu is extensive and has cheap prices for huge portions. I consulted Yelp reviews and chose the steak burger (~$7). It was a good bar burger with a huge plate of fries. The toppings were fresh and the cheese wasn't american (unless you specified american cheese...). The hubby just chose the enchiladas. Not all that exciting, but I didn't have high hopes for that dish.On to the beers. The selection was astounding and it was so hard to choose! I went for a seasonal beer that they still had around (haha! A Christmas beer that was delicious! It was something like the Breckenridge Christmas Ale.) For about $2 it was a steal! The hubby chose a Fat Tire of some kind and was very happy, of course (~$4).Our waitress was very nice and the lively crowd really cheered us up after a long, cold work week. I think we will be back for more casual happy hour dinners!"], ["Joi B.", "True confession time: I have a fondness for Ruffles potato chips and French onion dip. Or, at least I used to. Frito Lay used to make a delish French onion dip, the kind in that little tin can. I think it had been about 20 years since the last time I had it and I had been craving it, so I bought some for a party. NOT THE SAME ONION DIP! Either that or my taste buds have changed significantly since I was a young 'un, but I have pretty strong taste memories (or \"chewmories\" as the K would put it).Harry's, in their infinite wisdom, has somehow recreated the French onion dip I so enjoyed in my youth. Their homemade potato chips are outstanding as well (I can forgive that they aren't rippled like Ruffles:) Despite my best intentions, I scarfed down half of the huge basket and I think the K and I were about to fight over licking the dip bowl clean (I let him have the honor...JK).It's patio season and Harry's has gone under a bit of renovation, starting last fall, I believe, with an additional semi outdoor seating area (convenient on rainy nights), a stage for bands and what appears to be interesting industrial looking vessels with trellises (?), which I assume will \u00a0be planters. Last night the five of us sat outside and took advantage of the perfect Kansas City early summer weather (read: it's not over 90 after the sun goes down). Beer was flowing (wine for Yours, Truly, a decent Cabernet), old country tunes piped outside, courtesy of that amazing juke box, and you can't get a better Saturday evening, in my opinion.Now, to get that damn onion dip out of my head..."], ["Claudia S.", "I've been here a couple times. They have a nice patio when it's warm enough. We didn't have the most attentive waitress, but it was a big group. We had flat bread pizza and it was pretty good. They have a wide range of speciality cocktails at a good price, the menu of drinks could use more of a description so you know what you are getting when you order something with a goofy name."], ["Shane W.", "Harry's Country Club is an icon in my own mind. I've had a lot of great happy hours there, and they weren't the raucous occasions that afflict 20-somethings. Perhaps that's why I like Harry's so much. An aside: When referred to as \"Harry's, THIS is where you go, not the other one.There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Harry's though I agree that some good points have been made in the previous reviews about their inconsistent closing times and the service black hole on the patio.
