{"The Capital Grille": [], "La Bodega": [], "Michael Smith Restaurant": [["Robert G.", "My friend decided to take me to a belated birthday lunch, and the restaurant of choice was Michael Smith. I arrived early and waited near the front door on a bench, there were a lot of extra chairs stored in this area which seemed out of character for an upscale restaurant such as this. When my friend arrived we went to the front desk and were greeted promptly and with a warm greeting, we informed him of our reservation and he took us to our table.We had a nice table by the window, but we were right next to a folded up curtain which protruded into our table space. Our server came to the table quickly and was very friendly and upbeat. We were ready to order. We both ordered the cream of broccolini soup. I felt the soup was way under seasoned. There are not salt and pepper shakers on the table, so I felt it was out of place to ask for salt and pepper, but the soup could have really used at least some fresh cracked pepper. It was still good, but seasoning would have definitely helped.After the soup, we shared an order of the pork belly tacos. We both felt that this dish was the best thing either of us had, fresh and flavorful with a cabbage slaw, and the perfect amount of seasoning.I ordered the Hangar Steak with mashed potatoes, roasted cherry tomatoes, and tempura asparagus. My friend ordered the Chicken Picata. I really enjoyed my steak, but in my experience growing up working on a ranch, we always felt that the Hangar steak was a throwaway cut. I have seen it several times in fancy restaurants, and I wonder if they choose it because if you can make a Hangar Steak taste good, you must be a good Chef. It seemed to be cut with the grain instead of against the grain, which made it a bit tough, which a Hangar Steak tends to be anyway, but the flavor was excellent, and it was seasoned perfectly.Since I despise capers, I didn't try my friend's Chicken Picata, but he said it was very good as well, just not as good as the tacos.While waiting for the restroom, I passed by a room that appeared to be a wine-tasting room, but there were several boxes open with cuts and tears along the boxes as if they were opened and then just left there. I don't think this type of thing should be open to the public as it looks like something that was left by the dumpster. This coupled with the storage of chairs in the front makes me think the management should do a check of the restaurant to make sure guests can't see untidy things such as these. It wasn't bad enough to bring my rating down to a 3 mind you, but it definitely stuck in the back of my mind when I consider that this is supposed to be fine dining.The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was up-scale for the most part, I would definitely recommend you try it for lunch, as the prices were very reasonable, especially since I wasn't paying. I'm not sure how much more dinner would be. I had several people recommend that I try the rabbit as it's considered the House Specialty, but since I grew up in Kansas and frequented Western Kansas, I had enough people feed me Rabbit and Squirrel that I don't think I will ever order it in a restaurant. I'm giving it a thumbs up for lunch first to see what you think, and then maybe dinner if you like what it has to offer."], ["Gail N.", "Since it was Restaurant Week, it was my husband who suggested that we find a restaurant that we haven't been to yet. When Michael Smith came up, we quickly decided that was a place to give a try. \u00a0Since we moved here two years ago we have tried numerous restaurants, but tend to stay with some of our neighborhood favorites in Brookside. \u00a0Restaurant Week is an opportunity to give something new a try. \u00a0It was unfortunate that our server didn't seem to \"feel the love\" for RW. \u00a0We were asked if we wanted to order when he took our wine order, seeming to want to rush us through the experience. \u00a0We each started with the kale salad for the first course which was good, but not great. \u00a0We ordered the steak and the pork and they were beautifully plated. \u00a0The pork was very tender, and my husband enjoyed it. I thought the flavors were not as good as expected, when I tried a bite. \u00a0My steak was also perfectly cooked, and very good.We tried different desserts and they were both delicious. \u00a0The Dark Chocolate tart was a little crunchier than I expected, but it was decadent. \u00a0When we have an amazing dining experience it usually requires a blend of delicious food and amazing hospitality. \u00a0It was the hospitality quotient that was missing last night. \u00a0I would say the food was at least a 4 and the service was OK-not what you expect. \u00a0The decor was beautiful. \u00a0It might have been a down night, or as I said before, maybe Restaurant Weekers aren't treated the same way as regular patrons, but I see it as a missed opportunity to convert some of these folks to becoming regulars."], ["Julia F.", "One of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City. \u00a0Conveniently located near downtown, I always come here when I have tickets to the opera or theatre so I can have a nice meal before a show. \u00a0They have excellent service and a very nice staff. \u00a0The food is fantastic. \u00a0Some of my favorites include the rabbit appetizer, the yellow tail ceviche, the duck entree or the scallops. \u00a0If you like pork (which unfortunately I do not eat), they have an eight hour pork roast that is so good my mother orders it every time we come here. \u00a0The deserts are quite yummy and worth a browse through the menu. \u00a0It is nice when the chef seems to have both talent and inspiration in creating and executing a menu! \u00a0If I had to find one critical element to mar this otherwise glowing review, I suppose it is that the restaurant is a bit cold (temperature-wise), particularly in the summer. \u00a0(Yeah, that's how good this place is; I'm reduced to reviewing the thermostat to find something about which to complain) \u00a0Bring a little cotton sweater if you're going strapless and problem solved."], ["Rob M.", "Tonight was the first concert on our subscription at the new Kauffman Center and we felt like treating ourselves to a good dinner before the performance. \u00a0I'd scored a Groupon sometime this summer. \u00a0Making reservations online was a snap -- there were no problems getting the date and time we wanted.This evening we arrived about half-an-hour late, as we got stuck in a traffic jam on Hwy 69 in JoCo, which has been under construction for what seems like forever! \u00a0Fortunately, they hadn't given our table away and we were seated immediately! \u00a0There must have been a lot of other people going to the Kauffman who were dining there -- the place was full and most patrons were VERY dressed up! \u00a0We went ahead and ordered, explaining to our server that we were going to the symphony and had run late because of traffic. \u00a0He said he'd let the kitchen know so we could get to the performance on time. \u00a0My partner ordered the roast Campo Lindo chicken dish and I ordered the goose breast. \u00a0We both ordered the green salad with ripe figs. \u00a0I asked for a glass of the Marques de C\u00e1ceres and my partner ordered a ros\u00e9.The salads arrived promptly and were a tasty combination of arugula, candied walnuts and ripe figs. \u00a0I didn't try my partner's chicken dish. \u00a0It looked a bit small to me, but she said it was delicious and seemed very satisfied with it. \u00a0My goose was excellent -- numerous slices, nicely pink in the middle, served atop a bed of spinach with a melange of julienned vegetables on top of it and more of the figs, this time roasted a bit. \u00a0(I guess figs must be in season!)Service was careful and attentive, and we both were pleased with our meals. \u00a0There were some tempting desserts on the menu, but we decided to pass on them because we didn't want to be late for the concert. \u00a0For the two of us the total came to about $85. \u00a0The Groupon was for $60, so it actually went a long way -- farther than I expected! \u00a0Of course, we skipped dessert and coffee. \u00a0But all in all we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the service, and felt that the prices were reasonable for a restaurant of this quality. \u00a0We'll be back, especially because it's close to the Kauffman so it's perfect for a pre-performance dinner!"], ["Brandi C.", "My husband and I have wanted to go to Michael Smith since a friend of ours raved about it, and finally made it in last weekend. Even though it was freezing outside there were still plenty of people having dinner, so we were glad that we had made a reservation ahead of time.We were seated right away, and given menus that weighed about 5 lbs. each. Not that they were super extensive, just heavy! We were also provided with a wine list which is really decent - there are a few wines offered by the glass, but the selection of bottles is much larger, so we opted to share a bottle of very nice white wine, which (happily) was served at the perfect temperature. I started off with the watercress salad, and while it was good, it was nothing special. Just ok, really. What I should've done is ordered the rabbit gnocchi, which is what my husband had. It was excellent - very flavorful, and just the right sized portion. I will be ordering that the next time around for sure.For dinner, I had the scallops and my husband had the chicken breast. This time around, I think my option was the winner. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the pine nuts and golden raisins that accompanied it made for an interesting but very nice flavor and texture combination. At first, I felt that the portion was a bit small, but upon finishing, I was nicely full without being stuffed, so it was actually perfect. My husband did enjoy his chicken, but the bite that I had didn't really wow me.We couldn't leave without checking out the dessert options, and there was no way I was going to pass up the (amazing) chocolate, cinnamon, and blood orange concoction listed. We originally planned to share, but then my husband saw that panna cotta was also an option, so we each got our own dessert. I loved mine, he loved his, and we were both happy. I enjoyed a glass of Vin Santo with my dessert, and my husband had a coffee.All in all, we enjoyed a really good meal, and the price was more than reasonable for the quality. The restaurant actually got a little bit loud as the evening wore on and a couple of larger groups arrived, so it was a bit hard to talk at times, but other than that, we had a very nice time. I would say that Michael Smith is a perfect \"date night\" location."], ["Jeff K.", "It was my first time down town for first Friday and we ended the night off at Michael Smith. \u00a0From the look of this place it seem like we would be having a wonderful upscale dinner. But unfortunately the server was so bad it took away from the delicious meal that we were served. It took 15 mins before the hostess even \u00a0saw us standing at the desk, other 10 mins before we had the waitress greet us and take drink orders. \u00a0The restaurant wasn't even that filled, about half I would say. \u00a0To start off, we had the foie gras torchon (My first time having it) \u00a0and it was great. \u00a0For the meal we got the lamb rack and chicken dish. The lamb was cook perfectly but the chicken came out chewy and dry. After are meal we waited about 20mins before the plates were clear and another 10 before she asked if we wanted desserts. For being has pricey has the meal were, I expected more from the service and two well cooked meals."], ["Amy W.", "So we tried this place again at the behest of friends who pleaded with us to give it a go. It still doesn't work. I'm not sure what's not quite right for us, considering that people fawn over this restaurant. We're not militant vegetarians but the mention of wanting recommendations without meat sent the server into a tizzy. There must be bushels of vegetables and spices in the kitchen but alas we couldn't have them. Wish I had my $200 back."], ["Pat D.", "Michael Smith's is simply wonderful. \u00a0Was it meeting Chef Michael Smith as he worked the dining room? \u00a0Was it the perfectly cooked halibut dish or, the wonderful morel mushroom and liver appetizer? \u00a0Was it the fantastic presentation of the food so you know a real chef prepared it? \u00a0 \u00a0Or, was it the photo of Michael and Julia Child on the wall near the door? \u00a0The relaxed yet semi-formal ambiance? \u00a0It was all of the above. \u00a0Thank you Michael Smith for a perfect date night with my wife."], ["Jessica E.", "I had only heard good things about Michael Smith's restaurant so my expectations were undoubtedly high. I had only looked into the small, cozy and intimate setting, mostly in passing to get to Extra Virgin, but was pleasantly surprised at its humble, yet sophisticated nature. My sister and I paid a visit during KC Restaurant Week so we took part in the RW menu. For starters, I had the braised pork tortellini with tomato argue. The outer-shell seemed a tad overcooked and the flavors were lacking, but generally speaking, it was a decent dish. For my main course, I had the pan fried hanger steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, no complaints there. To finish off, the apple bread pudding was ranked right up there for me next to some of my most favorite desserts in KC. The ambiance is definitely classy and the waiter we had (Stefan) was awesome! My sister and I look like \"young kids out on the town\" but weren't treated as so. Stefan was patient with us and helped us select a delicious white wine to complement our dessert. The best part of the evening was when Michael Smith himself came up to our table to ask us how we enjoyed our meals. He is down to earth, humble and kind; a direct reflection of the service and overall experience we had at his restaurant."], ["Kim-Anh P.", "I was visiting KC for work, and this restaurant caught my eye. We came at an odd time in the afternoon so we were seated immediately. I was trying to look at the menu online but I didn't see the menu nor the items I remember ordering (I went mid-March 2011). So bear with me, I'm going to try remembering what we had. There was a section on the menu labeled \"For the adventurous\". I was all over that. I tried the grilled bone marrow, the duck tongue tacos; tried my co-workers rice and chorizo and a handful of other dishes. It was tapas style, so if you get that same menu I did, it's fun to get a few different dishes and share. About 2-3 dishes are most than enough for one person.I think the chef was a little heavy-handed on the salt that day. If I was back in KC, I think I'd stop by again try other plates on the menu."], ["Ted H.", "Came for lunch with a group of co-workers. \u00a0The decor is very nice, and the service was prompt and friendly. \u00a0My group ordered the braised rabbit, trout, pork cheeks, steak, and hamburger. \u00a0Everyone raved about how good their food was. \u00a0Many in the group tried the rabbit, and thought it was excellent. \u00a0I will definitely dine here again."], ["Sheri R.", "I love everything EXCEPT......I am nitpicking here but it is my pet peeve, the level of dust hanging above my head. I just hate it when EVERYTHING is A 10 EXCEPT the fuzzy appearance on the light fixtures and dirty air vents. \u00a0Details like that in cleaning is something I am acutely aware of. With the exceptional food and exceptional service the only thing that would ruin it would be the dust in the food.d \u00a0As a side note, I could not sit at the bar at Extra Virgin for the same reason. That beautiful work of art is fuzzy with dust."], ["Matt S.", "We recently moved to Kansas City and have had a good time trying all of the dining options. \u00a0We were excited to try Michael Smith based on things we heard and his James Beard awards. \u00a0We headed there Tuesday night, October 11th, with the intent of ordering a couple of bottles of wine, exploring the menu, and treating ourselves to dessert. \u00a0it didn't happen that way.Hostesses were not welcoming and too rushed to even say, \"enjoy your meal.\" \u00a0The service was lousy. \u00a0Our server was Tyler who showed up at our table requesting our drink order. \u00a0We placed an order for a bottle of wine and he brought a different bottle saying \"we were out of what you ordered but this is the same grapes and the same price.\" \u00a0He then asked us to order. \u00a0I had some questions and asked for his recommendation which was greeted with a less than interested and non-informative answer. \u00a0When I asked about the Whitefish dish his response was \"mild.\" \u00a0That's it. \u00a0So we placed our orders based on our own guesses and were happy for the most part. \u00a0The food was decent. \u00a0We finished our dinner and sat for 15 minutes at a table with an empty wine bottle, two empty wine glasses, two empty water glasses, an empty bread basket, and two dirty plates. \u00a0At this point we decided to forgo the other bottle of wine and dessert. \u00a0Our table was cleared and we asked for the check. \u00a0When he took my credit card away, a hostess wandered over, removed the empty bottle of wine and asked us if we would like more wine. \u00a0A little to little and way too late. \u00a0The atmosphere was congested and bland. \u00a0There was no music for the first half of the 45 minutes we were there. \u00a0We were at a corner table by the kitchen which fit the attitude of being ignored by the staff. \u00a0The couple that was seated next to us at the same time we were seated still didn't have their entree when we left...but they had two empty wine glasses. \u00a0Poor things had to endure the experience longer than we did.There was one shiny spot in the evening. \u00a0When we left we were going to go across to Extra Virgin for dessert and wine. \u00a0We decided we didn't want to give any more money to Michael Smith so we walked around the corner and came upon The Reiger Hotel and Grille. \u00a0What a find! \u00a0The Hostess, wait staff, and chef were the friendliest and most accommodating in town. \u00a0We enjoyed spending money here and the desserts and wine were yummy. \u00a0We are going back on Saturday night and I just scheduled a dinner in a couple of weeks when out-of-town friends come to town. \u00a0I would say avoid Michael Smith Restaurant and spend your money where it is worth it. \u00a0There are so many great places we are stumbling upon in Kansas City."], ["LN S.", "I love this place--it is always perfect! \u00a0The heirloom tomato salad with compressed watermelon was perfectly dressed and delicious.It is always a challenge to decide which fish to get--they are always perfectly cooked and composed.The waitress, Angie, who is always helpful and delightful, helped us choose an amazing dessert--warm peach cobbler with brown sugar ice cream. \u00a0What a great way to end the meal.I love to go here for date night or with friends who are craving something delicious. \u00a0Chef Michael and his staff \u00a0never disappoints."], ["Jill H.", "This place has it all wrong for an expensive, high-end restaurant. \u00a0 \u00a0Our waiter was cold and for $25 to $35 a plate, the food was ehhh- by far not spectacular and not worth the money. \u00a0 I ordered the most expensive item on the menu and was horribly disappointed. \u00a0The meat was so tough, I needed a saw to cut it. \u00a0This is coming from a foodie that travels often and lived in Las Vegas for 10 years taking clients and eating at very high end restaurants on a regular basis - the type where there are two waiters at your table and they treat each paying customer like a King and Queen. \u00a0I agree with the many negative reviews here on Yelp and with the many who bought the Groupon to give it a whirl and were disappointed. \u00a0Too bad, such a good opportunity to get repeat clientele and they obviously blew it time and time again.If you are a stuffy, wealthy KC resident that enjoys throwing your money away-by all means, eat here repeatedly. \u00a0 If you are hard-working and want to enjoy a good meal, pleasant atmosphere, and impress the wife or a date-avoid this place like the plague! \u00a0 \u00a0I can give you ten other local restaurants in KC that are five stars and half the price!I don't see this place in business, a year from now?"], ["David B.", "The pork"], ["Cathy C.", "Eight-hour pork roast was worth the wait! I had lunch here a long time ago and had a good meal, but was disappointed that it wasn't on the menu. So when I saw it on Michael's Restaurant Week menu, \u00a0I was THERE! Moist, fall-apart tender but somehow he gets this wonderful crispy crust on it! It sits on a pool of risotto, topped with a spicy jicama (I think) slaw. I loved it! My daughter had scallops-3 big tender ones. We rounded out the 3-course meal with velvety cauliflower-fennel soup and shared our desserts-lemon merengue pie with cranberry sorbet and gingerbread spongecake with chocolate ganache. I could have eaten a gallon of the sorbet, and the combination of ginger and chocolate made me think it was Christmas again-delightful! The wine list is a Wine Spectator award winner, and I would have loved to have his bottle of 1990 Ch. Latour, but settled on a glass of Rhone instead. It was just fine with the pork roast.Service was competent, friendly but unobtrusive. The sleek interior is a bit tight, but conversation was easy, even as the place filled up on Yo Yo Ma night at the Symphony (that's another review-OMG!). The kitchen kept up with the growing crowd well, without making us feel hurried. On the night of a very special musical experience, we had a very special dinner as well."], ["Sharon D.", "Four of us dined on a Saturday night and were expecting to have a memorable experience. Unfortunately this was not the case. The server was mediocre at best and at one point downright rude. We were studing the menu when she approached our table and asked if we were \"ready for her now.\" The chef was making the rounds of the room and introduced himself. When he realized we had not yet ordered he promised to come back later to see how things were. And of course this never happened. Food was just O.K. And very small portions, not to mention for dinner at 7:30 they were out of the whitefish which two of us had wanted. We ordered two bottles of wine, one for $80 and another for $75. \"Diver\" scallops were definitely not, being so tiny and one even smelled less than fresh. Lets just say we won't return. In fairness to the server, she did bring a higher priced port than two of us ordered to compensate for the entrees being unavailable. Even so, when we visit Kansas City next Fall we'll try another restaurant."], ["AJ G.", "Kansas City Restaurant Week - Michael SmithAfter our, shall we say, very unusual experience at Justus Drugstore, we approached our third \u00a0reservation for Kansas City restaurant week, at Michael Smith, with a little trepidation. \u00a0Not to worry. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly, although the fashionable room was full: \u00a0already a sign of good management. The room is small, but with comfortable dining furniture, adequate space between tables, and very nice flatware. The room is decorated with tasteful abstract art, and, in the center of the rear wall, a framed 8 X 10 photo of the chef, Michael Smith, with Julia Child. His relationship to her is not specified, but certainly is effective in implying a good pedigree. The full room had a happy buzz, but not so loud that conversation is difficult.This restaurant handled the prix-fixe menu in what seems to me the ideal way: you are presented with the regular menu, in case your preference runs in a different direction, as well as a nicely printed menu for restaurant week, with three choices for each course. Our party of three selected two of the three available first courses: a mixed greens salad, and butternut squash ravioli. The salad was served with a home-made flatbread, fresh, nicely presented, fairly unremarkable. The ravioli were served piping hot in a covered dish, with a wonderful broth and large flakes of parmesan. We devoured them.For the main dish, we all opted for the pan-roasted campo lindo chicken, which came as a breast accompanied by a large homemade potato pierogie, and a tasty brown sauce. It was garnished with saut\u00e9ed almonds and chestnuts: can't remember when I was last served a chestnut! Creative, interesting, and very enjoyable.We sampled the three desserts offered. \u00a0Lemon meringue \"pie\" received a modern treatment, as it came as a small rectangle of lemon custard on a crust, topped with little meringue chips. These were like tiny meringue cookies, shaped like large chocolate chips. Entertaining to the eye and the palate. \u00a0It was served with a scoop of cranberry sorbet, which was less intensely flavored than I had expected. The second was a little chocolate pecan tart, which was focused more on chocolate than pecan; very nice. It was served with a very creamy and intense tablespoon of chocolate espresso ice cream, and, for some reason, a thimble-sized cylinder of moist chocolate cake. Last was a spicy gingerbread sponge cake, which was paired with a bite of clove toffee; great complementary and creative flavors.Service was pleasant and efficient. In spite of a busy night, the staff appeared relaxed and welcoming. Water glasses were promptly refilled, as was the bread basket. All in all, a first class dining experience, at a great price, supporting a great cause. Kudos to Michael Smith for this effort."], ["Chris O.", "I have dined here several times for dinner and I think it is the best restaurant in Kansas City. \u00a0It is unusual that you find restaurants that could thrive in other major metropolitan areas, and this is one of them.My favorite is the tasting menus. \u00a0Each course is cooked and seasoned well, nicely plated, and the flavors are great. \u00a0The rabbit is super, the pork is outstanding, and the seafood is high quality. \u00a0I have only experienced good service at Michael Smith's. \u00a0My favorite server is Andie. \u00a0She is really knowledgeable about food, enjoys her job, and takes pride in great service."], ["Jansen F.", "Interesting to see the other reviews that all mention purchasing a Groupon to try Michael Smith and then being ambivalent about the meal.

I found the service cold but efficient. As far as the food: We ordered the soft Spanish tacos as an appetizer. They were not nearly as tasty as they sounded. Pretty forgettable really. Then they brought us beautiful looking rolls that were cold and tough. They weren't attempting to heat them but I think they would have tasted better warm. I had the beet salad and my companion a mixed green salad. Both were ok but each had an excessive amount of oil which seemed odd. I had a stuffed ravioli that was doughy and tough- icky. My husband had the braised rabbit which was the highlight of the meal- tender and served with amazing gnocchi. If not for the rabbit, I would have given this meal 2 stars.

Although what we had was good, it was smaller portions than it should be for the price. And while I'm someone who enjoys small plates specifically, and finer foods in general, I'd never go there again without a Groupon. I enjoyed my appetizer (which I ordered as dinner), some sort of ravioli with oxtail(?). Very good, but sorry, can't remember the name and they don't keep their online menu updated at all. My friend had the (I think it's called) 8-hour pork, which was very good and the green onion risotto underneath was delicious. The s'mores dessert was cute and creative, and yummy, but it's pretty obvious to anyone who has actually eaten one that you need two crackers, not just one, to go with the other ingredients on the plate.The cucumber salad was good, as were the Brussels sprouts, but someone is way over-salting both of them. Chef: Don't be so pretentious that you won't keep salt/pepper on the table, thinking that only *you* know how much salt should be on or in the food you offer. Hold back and let people judge for themselves whether they'd like less or more. I'm someone who appreciates the flavors of food without being overpowered by salt. My dining partner likes to add salt to everything. Be creative and confident in what you've created, but not controlling and egotistical. It's not YOUR palate we're paying to please.Also, your ventilation system needs help. Although it was a warm (not hot) evening outside, your AC shouldn't be blasting onto each table inside. We started to move, but noticed that the candle flames on every other table were dancing like crazy also, as all the vents are open too far and directed poorly. We were freezing, and the hot food _immediately_ got cold. You need to a) close the louvers a bit to cut down on the flow, or b) have some sort of re-direction things put on them to maybe direct the flow across the ceiling instead of down onto the tables. Ruins the ambience and your food temperature.Service was adequate, although he could use some lessons in warm interaction with the clientele."], ["Bethanie W.", "After reading the reviews I was nervous about my reservation at Michael Smith.

She was friendly, upbeat, and helpful with the menu and and wine. I had the Whitefish and it was delicious. Cooked perfectly and the potatoes and onion that accompanied it were just as wonderful. My wife has the scallops and they were cold, which was odd because we were one of five tables in the restaurant at the time. \u00a0We finished the meal with the hazelnut cake and it definitely help end the night with a bang - so good! The portions were very small, but that was expected as the up-scale restaurants seem to have smaller portions and my waistline appreciates this. :)My only tip would be to call in your reservations as the OpenTable always says they only have availability at 5 or 9, which obviously was not the case from what I saw. So I am unsure if they just don't utilize the OpenTable or if this method gets people in on the slow times."], ["Terra M.", "Whenever I'm feeling uninspired or ... underfed ... Popping in to Michael Smith is the sure way to cure those symptoms. The food is always perfect, not one morsel on the menu isn't worthy of the James Beard award, even when you order it to go.

That why it's always where we bring the posh Danish speaking folks from corporate, knowing full well they wouldn't expect this quality and beauty in the, *they shudder*, midwest.

I usually ordered the lamb dish they have on the dinner menu, but decided to try the KCRW menu instead. For the first course, I had the soup (crab bisque), which was a little bit too salty for my taste. Our soups unfortunately came out cold, not even the room temperature, but our server was very helpful, apologized, brought them back and heated them up for us. As for main entree, I had the seafood platter, which consists of grilled shrimp, tilapia and scallop. The seafood were well cooked and properly seasoned. We all did enjoy our meal a lot. The last course was dessert, and we had the chocolate churros and banana cake, they were delicious and were the perfect ending of the meal.I would highly recommend this place for those who appreciate great food, great service and great ambiance.

The ravioli were stuffed full and basked in a luscious tomato cream sauce, and the shrimp were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Beef and raisins together in a meat pie may sound strange, but trust me, these Argentinians know what they're doing.

We finally get the empanadas soon after this news, which to their credit were delicious. Then we proceed to wait another 30 minutes until we finally complain about the lack of concern for our table and the prolonged wait times to get our food.

We had it with the service and the attitude after being starved for 2 hours now, so we just got up and left. The last impression from the manager when he told us we could leave wasn't of remorse for our terrible experience, but of good riddance of customers he didn't want.

This is a very, very, sad thing as they were quite amazing! The goat cheese was oozing as you cut into the croquet. The taste perfect, just enough of that pungent taste that goat cheese needs, but not over powering. Very creamy with a bit of crunch from the outside. The croquets rested on top of a beet sauce that added the perfect sweetness to the goat cheese. I normally am not a fan of beets, but this combination is a huge win.The trout was good, lightly seasoned and perfect crispy skin. The lentils with it were bland, but mixing them with the herbed yogurt made them delicious. The chard was sauteed nicely. The meal really seemed to be designed to combine a little of each item into one perfect bite. Service was a little slow. Stood waiting for someone to seat me. A long wait before my orser was taken. Left sitting for a bit when done waiting for a box and to go container. But it was super friendly and the perfect amount of attentive.The place is small, with about a dozen tables.

Came in about 10:15 on a Monday and the restaurant was almost full. I would probably come right at opening next time just to be safe! My wife ordered the French toast but I ended up eating half of it and it was excellent. I had the Croque Madame with gruyere cheese (my favorite) and it was even more amazing. I was really hungry so I ordered an extra side of potatoes but given the generous portions that came with the sandwich that probably wasn't necessary.For $10 my meal wasn't overpriced in the least -- no more expensive than any of the other breakfast restaurants in town of its kind and just as good or better!

They also have a decent selection of wine to pair with your dinner.The venue... can get crowded. Luckily I visited while it was warm out and we took a table outside. It's not the largest venue around, so plan ahead and be prepared with a back-up plan if you didn't make reservations or if its busy.The parking... the neighborhood has limited parking, and there's one lot in the back. Everyone's experience will differ, but the first day I moved to KC, someone does a hit and run on my parked car there. Great way to start my KC experience.

If you could have free food for life from one restaurant in Kansas City, what would yours be? Mine would be Room 39 by a landslide. First of all, their brunch is one of the best in town. It's a somewhat smaller space, so it may be filled up if you show up at a peak time on a Saturday (of course) but it's worth it if you're in. They have great roasted coffee (Broadway Roasting Company for the win), and their ability to take the simplest things and make them taste incredible is top of the line. A side of potatoes is simply roasted with sea salt, but somehow manages to taste like the one of the best sides of potatoes you'll ever taste. It's a cop-out to say that \"everything on the menu is good\" but in this case, I'll cop-out because it's legitimate. Their staff is incredible, always very friendly and perfectly attentive. There's no negativity with anyone here.I frequent brunch here, and have had dinner only once but it was tremendous. This is a place that has always been farm-to-table without overly marketing it. Their genuine, local produce bursts with flavor and the portions are perfect in size. My recommendation could not be any stronger, check this place out whether it's a nice dinner date or grabbing lunch. It's a 10/10."], ["Steven F.", "I had never heard of \"Brioche\" anything before I moved here to Kansas City. Naturally, I felt a bit hesitant, ordering Brioche French Toast; however, the adventurer inside me begged to give it a shot--plus, it was listed with bacon and potatoes.

I don't know how he knew I ordered To Go, but I loved it! He was really nice and made sure that I had everything I needed. (By the way, I am a recycle nut and love to see the little \"fold the top\" containers! Always a plus!)It seems that homefried potatoes--I think that's what they call them--are a staple here. These were the best I've had so far! They were lightly seasoned and tasty all the way through, like they were prepared in butter or something. The bacon was delicious! Soft, salty (not too much but just right!), and succulent! I poured syrup over the bread--not too bad. The texture was a little dry so I drenched the bread pieces in syrup. AMAZING!!! I've had plenty of food with syrup and this was definitely one of the best! My only complaints were the parking and the Orange juice. I only saw street parking and 39th is a busy street! Now, the Orange juice--I am a die hard fan of fresh squeezed orange juice and this was made from concentrate, which I despise. All things considered, I think fresh squeezed would be a great fit at this restaurant. Overall though, I give it a B+, like an 89.3.

The service is also on point with all of the staff being fast and accommodating. Although, I have to warn all those who like window tables, the sun pours into this place, so keep that in mind for your late afternoon visits! Yelper Mom has been here before, but this was my first actual visit, so the menu was new territory for me. We decided to split an order of the cool spinach and artichoke dip and literally ate all of it. The fresh chips that come with it were a great compliment to it and better than most, but I probably could have eaten it by itself with a spoon and been equally happy. We both went with sandwiches, Yelper Mom going for the Summit Burger (which she said was cooked perfectly) while I went with the Chicken Sandwich (I can't remember if it had a more specific name). The brioche bun was light and buttery and the barbeque sauce was a little sweet with a bite to it, both of which perfect compliments for the juicy chicken breast with melted cheddar cheese and bacon.

Some of it from the adorable garden that you can view if you choose to sit outside. This is a go to spot for me because I feel safe eating here with my dietary restrictions. There are items clearly marked on the menu, as to what can be modified. But the fact that I have always been able to communicate with my server, and the kitchen in regards to any additional questions or restrictions I might have keeps me coming back. For those who may be needing to eat gluten free, dairy free, vegan, or vegetarian, I personally feel that the Westside Local can accommodate you. They have a solid, seasonal menu with a decent variety of options and price points. The bar menu is just as solid. You could have a lovely date here in the dining room, or a casual meet up with friends outside, or in the bar nook area. If you are not that hungry, try out the rotating localities, which start at $2.50. You can order one to add to your dish, or mix and match, building your own appetizer plate. I have been known to order one of everything in my realm of allowed foods, and build that plate as my meal itself.We have yet to be disappointed when dining here. Another thing that I like with the menu they have offered thus far, is the options for size portions on the salads. And they are always generous, even with the smaller portion.

But Yelper Daughter insisted, having enjoyed a baby shower here last week, and this time everything was spot on.We started with spinach artichoke dip, which is way different and way better, I think, than the gloppy cheesy version you get everywhere else. I don't know what they use for a base, but it's light and creamy instead, and the tortilla chips with them are better than most. I loved the Summit burger cooked medium, just a tiny bit pink in the middle. I ordered it on greens and got a bun instead, but I wasn't sorry. A bite of YD's Chicken Sammy was delicious too, as were her fries, thin and crispy outside, fluffy in the middle. The service was friendly and prompt, and the music was fantastic that day-tasty smooth jazz with just enough pep in its step to keep it interesting.

Prices are what you'd expect from a trendy F-t-T restaurant. Let me just say the b&g took my breath away. MASSIVE EPIC PORTION. A part of my soul died when I gave up midway thru and boxed it. (Next time I'm going half order!) Their buttermilk biscuits and breakfast potatoes are what dreams are made of. Everything just really comes together here, the food, and the service. On a side note, I wish I had tried the house banana bread since I noticed a lot of people had ordered some. An additional star: Rockstar pup service. I love dining at establishments that are dog friendly. Sometimes I feel a little overwhelming for places with TWO furry ones weighing in at about 50 lbs each. Nope, not here because my husky twins were well taken care of! It was a little awkward sitting on the bench style seating whereas with table/chairs, I can just worry-free loop the leash thru a chair leg and presto I'm done. I had to get a bit creative with cinching the leash around my thigh and keep them from licking the other patrons calves. (I am so sorry if that was you! & I swear I'm not the lady in Kay's review.)

Cassoulet? More googling...Anyway, so I ordered the sweet potato quinoa burger with hummus instead of cheese. Jalapeno is one of the ingredients but trust me, there was not even a hint of spice. Overall, it was a good burger. Filled me up. But it was one of those 'you only try once' dish, not good enough to eat again and again. However, those fries dipped in garlic aoili was an entirely different story! Golden crispy and perfectly seasoned. I also got a bite of my sister's kale chicken wrap.

I'm not a big fan of the sweet chili bbq sauce on top because it seems to overpower the fish's flavor and just tasted like plain tomato sauce. I could not taste the ginger in the ginger-coconut risotto. On the other hand, my coworker have said very good things about the osso bucco.

So, if I haven't raved about it enough, their fries are a must order I tell you! The grilled cheese was just as delicious. The bread is toasty yet moist and that white cheddar cheese is very tasty. The tomato fennel soup is really a good pairing for their grilled cheese, so kudos to the chef here.The people are friendly and they really know the food well.

We can't wait to come back!"], ["Tricia H.", "In Italian when we eat we Mangia!!! That's exactly what I did here!!! I Mangia and I Mangia and I loved it!!!

I was in love at first bite of the tuna cerviche tacos!!!! Thank you restaurant week for opening my eyes!! I cannot wait to go back!"], ["Tee S.", "This was our first meal in KC coming from out of state. I ordered several small plates that I thought would be interesting to try. \u00a0This place has eurasian influenced food, not a typical Spanish Tapas place. I ordered the pig ear salad, chicken thighs wrapped with figs, bone marrow, and spanish meat balls.The pig ear salad had nice, crispy ears mixed with arugula and vinegrette. The bone marrow was good. The chicken and fig was sweet and did not taste spectacular. It definitely didn't have that taste like it was freshly cooked. The Spanish meatballs was kind of bland and undercooked. Overall, 2/4 dishes were good."], ["Randy G.", "The feel of the place us great. Fun, energetic, staff is great, nice layout but the food was okay.

Also had the most amazing sea urchin pasta!"], ["Angelica E.", "Michael Smith is one of my favorite chefs in Kansas City. Ive followed his cuisine since 40 Sardines. I rate this restaurant a two because of poor service. Sadly my experience at Extra Virgin was tainted by the barkeep, a tall blonde guy, and his condescending and extremely immature demeanor. Its really difficult to enjoy good food with bad service. I ordered every menu item with oysters on the menu the mac & cheese and grilled ricotta bread while sipping champagne. Fabulous! The chefs here really enjoy what they do and it shows in the way the flavor of their food comes together."], ["Eric F.", "The food was good but not.great but for the price it was a good find ..drinks were really good"], ["Marek S.", "Great spot to start the night off especially during happy hour. Try the pork belly steam buns and shrimp fried rice! Very attentive staff and great red wines."], ["Divine A.", "We always enjoy our food and the service every time we come. One small request: New stuff on the menu please!!!"], ["Nick G.", "When my wife and my 10-year-old son arrived at Extra-Virgin, we entered a pleasantly decorated, rather swanky, restaurant that clearly catered to a tapas crowd. \u00a0Steven, our server, immediately presented us with menus of exotic dishes. Upon inspection of the menu, we saw that the price for the servings matched the prices of tapas restaurants that we have encountered in Orlando, Atlanta, and New York City. We therefore ordered what we thought was a sufficient array of dishes to satisfy our pallets. \u00a0Our excitement of what we were ordering was enhanced by the smells, aromatic and spicy, emanating from the kitchen. We informed Steven that we were passing through and this would be a one time event for us. He quickly went over what he thought were the best choices to make off the menu, and we complied, wishing to pair a string of dishes that would match a culinary theme. \u00a0He reassured us that \"somehow whatever we chose would all come together in the end.\"How right he was. Our first round of happiness included duck tongue tacos with spicy pickled onions and queso fresco. \u00a0The gamey and sour flavors were attenuated by the small chunks of the creamy cheese, and it was a subtle but nevertheless delicious opening foray. \u00a0The sea salt brought out for us to spoon on as needed brought these flavors out more fully. \u00a0The chickpea fries were stacked in a log cabin presentation which was appealing visually, and the plate contained a smear of a red pepper sauce. \u00a0This was a surprise, for this side was a truly novel experience for us, and we enjoyed the fries immeasurably throughout the meal, using them to soak up the juices of subsequent dishes that followed.Our next round of culinary delights included peppers stuffed with morcilla sausage and Pecorino cheese, both of which gave the piquillos a long finish of several layers of favors. \u00a0In addition, chorizo and fig filled chicken thighs served as a sweet counterpart to the peppers, and its juice was a perfect partner for the aforementioned chick pea fries. \u00a0The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, was a dish traditionally representative of the most basic of American staples: macaroni and cheese. \u00a0In the world of Extra-Virgin, macaroni and cheese exemplifies the concept of gourmet. The dish was prepared with poblano cheese and served in sizzling iron skillets. The combination of creaminess with the brittle crispiness of its shell and its sides which stuck to the pan were pleasant to chew, sensual for the tongue and pallet, and layered with a long finish of taste which paired ably with the locally brewed beers we drank. \u00a0How could so much food fill three people up so satisfyingly? \u00a0I think it was that in the bursts of favors, the sensuality of the textures, and the balance of the foods and spices used to prepare the tapas we were forced to slow down in order to savor every bite. \u00a0By the time we were ready to finish with a cheese assortment, we had to ask Steven if he had begun to prepare it, and upon finding out that he had not, we were able to gratefully cancel as its presentation would have been overload.Steven was right: it all came together, and in a very big and glorious way. It is a great value for the price, for the portions of the tapas were generous. Extra-Virgin unequivocally gets the RSA: the Roaducation Stamp of Approval ... at the highest level! \u00a0Thank you, Michael Smith!"], ["D V.", "My wife and I went here Saturday night for dinner and had a wonderful time. \u00a0We are foodies that love bold, interesting flavors and something outside of the norm for Kansas City. \u00a0Wait times were reasonable, service was impeccable (friendly and attentive without being obtrusive) and the food was amazing.We had the chick pea fries, duck-tongue tacos, heirloom tomato and ricotta cheese plate, avocado and something tacos, and a take off on shrimp ceviche. \u00a0Great twist on the traditional cocktails too.Dinner for two with one round of drinks came to $80 all-in, so it's a little pricey, but I feel it's a good value given the quality and variety of food you receive.We'll definitely be making the drive up from south OP just so we can try more things from the menu!"], ["Zac S.", "This place is fantastic. Berto at the bar creates some great drinks and makes for a fantastic dining experience. Try the pork belly steam bun."], ["Anthony G.", "Having recently moved to KC and looking for some high quality places to eat, I was directed towards Michael Smiths and Extra Virgin. 1. Atmosphere - With an extremely energetic and great bar filled environment it was a really just \"fun\" all over. Staff knows their menu and Bartenders know every drink in the book, how to explain it for a novice, and how to really make your time enjoyable. 2. Food - INCREDIBLE... for a Tapas place, I was extremely impressed. We ordered 5 plates to test. We ordered to hummus, the shrimp fried rice \u00a0(MUST GET), Spanish Meatballs, The hanger steak, and for Dessert the Pear Crostada.3. Bar - As I mentioned earlier the bar was very impressive but many key items stand out. The bar space is great, no matter where you sit, you have en elegant view of everything want to see. I ordered \"The Last Word\" which was a first for me but very enjoyable. It's always fun to be in the middle of actions that witnesses all the and food coming your your way or around it4. ONE MAJOR SETBACK WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE RECEIVING 4 STARS RATHER THAN 5. I never brought this to the attention of any manager but I should have. As mentions earlier we ordered the Hanger Steak, which was delicious by the way. It was prepared with a side of kale but the steak is rarely cooked and sliced thin. After enjoying it, I turned around to notice the cook preparing all of these Steaks so it was clearly a high seller. While watching him, there were no gloves worn whatsoever. I'm not a picky person but growing up in the food industry I know you can't do that. If your chefs are visible to the front of the house, you CANNOT be putting your raw hands on every dish you prepare. That's is just a no-no. I witnessed him grabbing multple raw pieces of meat along with the kale itself and other dishes without washing a single finger or ever decided to use gloves. What bothers me the most is the fact that the restaurant is set up that way in which w can see them prepare... if I can see you touch my food, please give the customer a since of security when eating because it was flat out DISGUSTING. Blood from someones steak then to grab the kale without the use of tongs is unacceptable and I hope Michael is informed. Overall besides one incident, I loved it, I will return, and I will recommend to everyone."], ["Alexander R.", "My wife has been wanting to go here for a while now. I wish we had gone before they got bored with what they were doing. The place was slow. But it still took over 8 minutes to be greeted by our server. We were seated as she cleaned the table next to us. When she continued to clean as I stood waiting to be able to pull out my chair, I thought, please don't let this be my server. She isn't planning on being sat anytime soon. But, as her little bee tattoo buzzed by us two or three times, attending to the neighboring tables, I realized that we were indeed, in her section. My old fashioned was very good. But the food was bland and boring. I've had better deviled eggs at church picnics. Don't get me wrong, the food was all cooked well (only the chicken thighs were burnt). It was quite a disappointment. After spending 20+ years in kitchens, I understand how a restaurant can become content with just churning out the same thing and getting comfortable. But, when I am out for my 20th anniversary, I'm hoping to get something amazing. Or at least intriguing. I hope to try them again, once they have regained interest in what they are doing."]], "Potpie": [["Amanda A.", "Amazing - it's like a little French bistro, nestled into Westport. I add the French definition for a couple of reasons: lots of small tables close together, rustic decor, and absolutely amazing food. It's not fast food, but it's good food. We've been there several times and I've never had a bad dish, but I'll put in really strong recommendations for the mussels and the roasted chicken. I know, chicken usually equals boring, but not here. The roasted chicken is one of my favorite plates in town!!"], ["Angela S.", "My sister and I went in just before 5pm, which was perfect! \u00a0No line, not busy. Being from out of town, I learned about Potpie from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. \u00a0We were not disappointed. We ordered all the favorites: mussels, goat cheese salad, chicken pot pie, beef and mushroom pot pie, and chocolate chip bread pudding. Everything was delicious!The muscles were plentiful, and the sauce was great for dipping. Salads were tasty and had generous amounts of goat cheese spread on bread accompanying the plate. \u00a0For the price, the actual salad could've been better. Pot pies were both delicious, and in my opinion, not too salty - and I don't salt anything, so I'm pretty sensitive when my food has too much salt. \u00a0We finished up with what is probably the best bread pudding I have eaten.Good, friendly, table service. \u00a0Food service was a bit slow, especially since they weren't busy, but they did have to bake our meals, so I'm not complaining too loudly.I wasn't in a position to try to cocktails or wine list, but I would have if I could have. Great for a date night, OK for older kids, but not for those who are young enough to get antsy waiting for their meal.I will go back if I'm in town again."], ["Riad S.", "You have to get a reservation if you want to eat here on the weekends and you will still most likely have to wait a little once you get there since the place is really small.The mussels were great.

Lastly I had the chocolate bread pudding which was one of the better bread puddings I've had. I would highly recommend this restaurant."], ["Josh A.", "Had a really great experience eating here. I got to sit at the bar and watch the bartender Vic make his famous Old Fashion. He was very knowledgable on all the different whisky drinks available.

I really liked it."], ["Allen R.", "We went not thinking we needed a reservation and got really lucky to get a table because the place was packed. \u00a0There was nowhere to stand and wait and all the table are jammed really close together. \u00a0I never like going to places where you are so close to other tables and people that you have to listen to their conversations as well as yours. \u00a0Having said all that, we were seated and ordered what else but, pot pie. \u00a0The place is called that so it's hard to go there and not order their mainstay. \u00a0I ordered the beef & mushroom and another reviewer ordered the chicken pot pie. \u00a0Our server was great and there were no problem here. \u00a0It does take a while to get your pot pie so if you are starving and need something quick, this might not be it. \u00a0It was a good 30 minutes before our pot pies are served and they were served SMOKING hot. \u00a0They were so hot there was no way you could eat them for another 10 minutes while we waited for them to cool down. \u00a0I just thought my beef & mushroom pot pie was okay. \u00a0The beef was somewhat chewy and the flavor just needed to hit higher levels. \u00a0I was able to try the chicken pot pie and I thought it was better. \u00a0There were some things I would change about them though too. \u00a0The first being the pot pies do not have a bottom crust. \u00a0They only have a top crust. \u00a0I love having pot pie with the bottom crust as well as the top. \u00a0I would also not use a puff pastry for the top crust. \u00a0I would use more of a flour pie type based crust because, I just feel it meshes best with pot pie. \u00a0The other thing I would do is just add more different kinds of pot pies. \u00a0The place is named pot pie and they offer 2 different kinds, so not much variety. \u00a0It's a place I will definitely be back when I am in the mood for some good comfort food."], ["Quintin C.", "Okay so we had a kidless afternoon and spent it down at Westport! \u00a0 Found PotPie here on yelp actually! \u00a0I have to say we absolutely loved this place!!! \u00a0Quaint, character, and EXCELLENT good! \u00a0 So good and such a down town gem. \u00a0Wife had the chicken pot pie and it was awesome. \u00a0I had roasted chicken which was also very very good. \u00a0We started off with sausage and split pea soup and I must say it was off the chain good!!! \u00a0Finished with chocolate chip bread pudding. \u00a0Are you kidding me??This will be a place we bring out of town guests for sure to showcase local KC! \u00a0Loved it!"], ["Daniel K.", "Pot Pie is a nice little restaurant in Westport.

Obviously, we didn't find it to be so for us...Everything started out okay, but quickly went downhill once being seated close to the server station and open kitchen. My complaints don't have anything to do with the service or food (which we left before getting), but the food safety practices and behaviors, or lack thereof, of the entire staff including the owner whom waited on us. We watched as nearly all of the front of house staff ate off of small plates while standing over the bread that was being cut and served to all the tables. They would shove food in their mouths and then would proceed to immediately grab bread to serve to patrons. From the bartender to the cooks in the kitchen, not a single person washed their hands, ever, even after going outside and coming back in after presumably smoking. It was obvious with the servers in front because the only sink available to do so was covered with a silverware bin. If that wasn't enough, my wife then noticed the head chef/cook that was making salads and plating dishes was dipping tabacco and spitting in a coke can he had right below the make table....never washing hands and spitting in his can right above all the plates coming out of the kitchen...repulsive. It shows a total disregard, on the owners standpoint, of leadership and care of their customers to allow these behaviors to take place in their business."], ["Katie M.", "I have been here 4 times and each time the food has been exceptional.

I've grown to trust that everything on it will be excellent, even when it sounds like... an experiment. Each recipe has a lot of thought behind it and is cooked with care. Generally too much care, BTW, for a quick meal - and they are proud of the fact.Pot Pie serves seafood fit for visitors from any coastal city.

Surprising, but I think the pan roasted chicken was actually better. It was extremely tender and came with some sides. The beef pot pie was good, but I think a more tender meat would have made me like it more (but I didn't want to chicken dishes). I felt that after about half or so of the beef pot pie, the flavor was just a bit overwhelming (could also be two entrees, but I think the flavor point is right).The venue... I arrived without a reservation (boo on me). However, the staff was very up front about my chances for getting a table and noted that some prior reservation was already well past, and that they were going to give them some more time and a call. \u00a0If they didn't show it was mine for the taking. With a bit of waiting and patience, they were able to squeeze a table of four in and we had no problems at all.The staff...

The filling is pretty traditional and didn't blow me away with flavour or anything - standard creamy broth with carrots, peas, corn, and chicken. \u00a0The scallops were good, but you only get three of them, plus a small portion of (tasty) fennel risotto and a few asparagus spears for $22...definitely overpriced in my mind. \u00a0It was good, but I don't know who could eat that and feel full.The crown jewel of the night, though, was the chocolate chip bread pudding, which is served in a hot ramekin with a little pitcher of creme anglaise. \u00a0Absolutely decadent and delicious. \u00a0The bread pudding is made with challah and croissants from Le Monde bakery in North Kansas City. \u00a0I would go back just for this gem.All in all, an ok meal. \u00a0Not terrible by any means, but not phenomenal either. \u00a0I would like to try this place again sometime, though. \u00a0The service was good, I liked the atmosphere (nice place for a date), and the food was above par. \u00a0Parking can be a pain, though, so I recommend trying to find a spot on a side street and walking over."], ["Joseph P.", "I am usually the kind of guy that is extremely gung-ho about watching my carb intake in order to stay in shape for bboying.
