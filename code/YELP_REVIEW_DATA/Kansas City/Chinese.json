{"Blue Koi": [["Ruth N.", "Sometimes I trust yelp enough to pick my meal based off of reviews. I saw raving reviews for the firebird chicken, so I opted for the firebird duck and asked for noodles. It's $2 extra for noodles, so I thought, \"This better be worth it!\" When the waiter brought out the bowl, my nose was greeted with a slightly sweet but tangy smell, and to my pleasant surprise, it was slathered with satay bbq sauce. The noodles are delicious, but the duck and green onions could afford to be a little more succulent and less overcooked. I ordered the bubble tea, expecting semi-decent boba for Kansas City, but maybe I have to try other places before I judge. Imo, the boba was undercooked, too chewy, with the middle having a different texture than the outside. The chai latte was good though, would have been just as tasty without the boba. All in all, the firebird flavor was very nicely done, execution mehh.."], ["Matt T.", "Popped in here without knowing anything about the place, turned out to be a good choice. The server was very helpful in giving suggestions and even proposed the servings were big enough to share but we wanted to sample a couple of dishes. We started with pan fried dumplings with awesome sauce which were very tasty. Our entrees were the Chinese pot roast in noodle soup, which had very tender meat and a nice ginger flavor which did not overwhelm the dish, and almond chicken and asparagus with noodles. The almond chicken was sort of the star of the entire experience in fact if we ever come back, which I would be all for, it would be hard not to order this dish again."], ["Audrey J.", "Family and I visited KC earlier this year and we stopped by Blue Koi after seeing it on DDD in our hotel room while in KC! We were not disappointed at all. Very tasty food. We obviously had to wait, but it was not too terribly long. I ordered a strawberry bubble tea, and got it cold. I personally, didn't love it. My mom enjoyed it though. So that's good. It's obviously a popular thing here. Maybe I would need to try it again. I don't know. Before we ordered our meals we ordered the Crispy Tofu with Awesome Sauce, and the pan-fried dumplings. For me, our appetizers were the high light of my meal. So tasty. I could drive back to KC for both of those... Mmm....... For my entree I ordered the Chinese style pot roast over the noodles. I'm glad I got it over the noodles because the noodles were so fresh and just so comforting. The pot roast itself was decent. Not as melt in my mouth as I was hoping, but it was for sure good. I think I will try something different next time. My mom got some chicken dish with asparagus, and hers was good, but not outstanding to me. And my step dad got the firebird duck. He loved it apparently. I didn't try it. My favorite part of this experience was the appetizer and the service, for sure. After watching the show we saw that the restaurant is owned by two very vibrant sisters! The sister who made the tofu with awesome sauce on DDD was at the restaurant and came over to talk to us! She was so sweet, and I really loved seeing her just after watching her on tv! It was pretty cool. She is exactly how she was on the show, which I loved.I'm looking forward to coming back again when I'm in KC to try more of the dishes here!"], ["Kristi A.", "After being a regular customer of this establishment and its other location for years, I had the absolute worst experience possible dining at the 39th Street location recently, and won't be returning to Blue Koi in the future. Our friends from South Dakota came down for their first visit to KC and our friend is vegetarian, so we thought what better place to take them than Blue Koi, home of the most delicious veggie dumplings ever, right?! So it was Saturday night and we knew it'd be busy. We had a party of seven and expected to wait. We arrived and were told it'd be around an hour wait. Okay, no problem. We'll grab a beer at the very crowded bar. So each person in our party orders one drink. Upon finishing this drink, my husband and his friend, attempted to order another beer, and were told by the gentleman behind the bar that he could no longer serve them. My husband inquired as to why they were not being served, and the guy informed him that they'd had enough and that my husband's friend looked sleepy. Meanwhile, there was an incredibly intoxicated older gentleman on the other side of us at the bar that was disruptive and intrusive to all patrons at the bar, and he was being served. We were not loud or disruptive, and had each had one beverage at this establishment. My husband is British, as is his friend, and tried to explain to the barman that he could understand why he thought they were intoxicated, because it probably sounded to him like they were slurring and/or mumbling when they speak quickly to each other. The barman did not care for any explanation and informed us he was the owner, which we later found was not true. We decided to go ahead and be seated, because we'd waited over an hour and were all starving. After being seated at our table, our waitress took drink orders from other people in our party, and then took our food order. Twenty minutes later, the food came out and we still had not one single drink on our table. Our server then informs us that our entire table had been cut off, and she was not allowed to serve us. Well, thank you kindly for waiting until our food came out to tell us. At this point, everyone at our table is very upset, and we ate our entire meal in silence. It was absolutely the worst dinner I've had out at any restaurant anywhere, and to top it off they were out of veggie dumplings. Our friend got no dinner and was too angry to order after being treated so poorly at the bar. After later inquiring with the server about why we'd been cut off, we found out that the barman was not the owner and not even the manager, so we requested to speak with the manager. She found a million things to do before coming over to our table. She finally came over and we explained what an awful experience we'd just had in her restaurant, and she clearly didn't know what to say. It took forever before we could even get an apology and for her to acknowledge that she was not aware of the entire situation before cutting off our entire table. She just knew what she'd been told by the jerk behind the bar. We were offered free dessert as compensation for our ruined dinner, to which no one was up for after painfully sitting there in silence through our meal.This experience ruined what was meant to be a fun night out with friends. We were appalled at being treated the way that we were in this establishment and will not be going back. I would be embarrassed for anyone to be treated the way we were and the response by the restaurant management was less than satisfactory. Absolutely horrendous customer service. We should have walked out, but as a table of former service industry employees, we didn't want to short our server, who was not at fault in this situation."], ["Joseph T.", "I went with high expectations and a friend who is Taiwanese. The decor is trendy as were many of the other diners that evening. Service was very good. However, the food itself was a mixed bag. We tried several different dumplings, all were excellent. \u00a0The tofu appetizer was boring and the dipping sauce seemed bottled. I had the ants on trees, based on other reviewers and was disappointed. Plenty spicy, which I like, but the \"ants\" were drowning in oil. I've had this dish in many restaurants and, when done well, the meat is slightly crisped and overall should be no more greasy than a good Pad Thai. \u00a0The noodles had decent bite but the abundance of oil was off-putting. My friend didn't get a main course and instead kept ordering more dumplings. She was pretty happy with all of those and I liked them as well.

There was absolutely no flavor whatsoever, and this was just chicken and noodles. That's it. No veggies or anything.The Chicken Curry was only slightly better. It was supposed to have some heat to it but there was no spice at all. The curry was liquidy and running all over the place. Button mushrooms were a cheap cop out to try and elevate the dish. We said something to the waiter about the Ginger Basil Chicken and he took it off the check and said he would bring complimentary chicken dumplings out. After being told they would be \"right out\" and waiting an additional 15 mins, we finally paid our bill and left.

We split an order of Spicy Chili Wontons (Vegetarian, wife forced of course ) and it was tasty. Nice building heat. Paired it with a New Belgium 1554 Black Lager (nice). For dinner I had the Chicken Basil lettuce wrap appetizer and the wife had the Vegan Delight soup. Lettuce wraps were very tasty (nicely sweet) however Wife's soup was more chore than delight. Everything in the soup had to be removed and cut down from 3 to 4 inches in length to enjoy with a spoon. Not adventurous either as the waitress had described. Overall, service was good, quality was good atmosphere was good. I will return."], ["Jordan A.", "Liked the friendly ambiance of the restaurant. I went in for lunch on a Thursday by myself because I has been craving some dumplings and after scrolling through yelp I chose this over Po's right down the street.I started off with the fried tofu with awesome sauce because it was pretty busy and I had a feeling my actual meal would take a while (I was spot on with this). Although it was busy and my order took a little bit of time my server was very attentive. He even helped a couple next to me by recommending some of his preferred gluten-free options. As for the food, the fried tofu was okay. The true star of the starter was the awesome sauce. It was really tasty. I basically drenched the rather bland tofu in the sauce because it was that flavorful. For my main meal I ordered the Shanghai Wonton Soup with meat. It was honestly one of the best Asian meals I think I have ever eaten. There were wonton dumplings stuffed with a pork mixture floating along side freshly made noodles, fresh cilantro, green onions, and bean sprouts. I added a bit of sriracha too. This dish was so warm and delicious. It had a nice heat and excellent flavors which surprised me because the soup had a clear broth. I definitely underestimated it! The dumplings were soft and slightly sweet due to the pork mixture. The noodles were tender and fun to try to eat with chop sticks! Also, this portion size was HUGE. I could barely eat half. Prices were decent especially for the size and quality of the food. I would definitely recommend this friendly and tasty option to anyone in the area! 4 stars - Keep it up Blue Koi!"], ["Joe B.", "Had the Fire chicken, great meal! Hot tea was great.

I told her that I had just called about ordering Thai tea, she replied with, \"I thought you said Chai tea, and this is a Chinese restaurant, so we don't have Thai tea.\" After the uncultured reply, she proceeded to recommend that I go to Vietnam Cafe if I wanted Thai tea.

I don't live to far from this place and decided to give it a shot and being mislead by other yelp reviews I decided to order carryout and give it a shot. Again, ewwwww.

In fact that HAS to be why the place is still open, it is CERTAINLY not due to tasty menu items. \u00a0I got basic things like egg rolls, chicken with broccoli and chicken friend rice, to be safe. I mean, if you mess those up...ehhh. Yeah, the egg rolls tasted like death, the hint of sugar in them was unappealing especially with a hot mustard aftertaste. The \"brown sauce\" on the chicken was horrible. I say on the chicken bc they neglected to douse any on the broccoli, which wasn't entirely cooked.

We ordered to go and had to take it back to a house that had no napkins, waiting for running water, and the $35 plus worth of food bags had no napkins in the bag, silly me should've known better this may be a grab your own napkin restaurant. \u00a0The sauce from all the boxes was oozing out making the bag and utensils and back of boxes all sticky. \u00a0Kind of annoyed me that I couldn't enjoy my meal and that myself and others had to endure a meal so messy it was not what we signed up for. \u00a0I think if the business was going to pack the stuff so poorly, they should at least provide napkins or at least ask us if we needed any if it's not in the bag already with the utensils. \u00a0Food taste normal, but I rather go back for lunch buffet than buying what we did since the buffet was only $5.94 after tax."], ["Dave P.", "I have only gotten delivery.

I'm not sure why. I wouldn't want wings, but really? Rangoon aren't that expensive. Luckily BF ordered the meat option and gave me one of his.At any rate, there were two tables of options, one with meat, seafood and noodles, one with vegetables and tofu and then a third filled with sauces and spices and oils.You pile all your choices in a bowl and bring it to the grill to be cooked. There you could also pick up an egg to add to the mix. The chef was fast and friendly.My dish creation was quite good, although initially the choices are almost overwhelming.

The selection of meats, veggies, sauces etc. is somewhat smaller than that of their most obvious corporate competitor, but the main problem I have is that the grilling area is so small that it becomes a total clusterf*** when the restaurant is busy. I ate there yesterday and because the restaurant was full at the time I decided to order off of the menu for a change. Since it was lunch I was able to get a pretty tasty rice noodle dish with beef for a reasonable price ($8.50), and certainly cheaper than the Mongolian barbecue ($12, I think).

It's just the perfect descriptor. We of course go for the Mongolian BBQ. They have a decent number of options, especially for proteins. As with any restaurant of this type, it's sort of your fault if the food isn't good, but I would have liked to have seen a few more recommended sauce recipes. They had 3, and they were all pretty boring. Plus, a good number of both sauces and vegetables were empty. The place wasn't busy and it was prime dinner hour, so I don't think that's acceptable. I now remember why it's been probably two years since I've been here. A couple of notes, however. 1) I have been told the off-menu food is amazing, some of the best in town. I haven't tried it, though, so I can't comment. Just passing along the gossip.2) My server was AWESOME. She was friendly, funny and on top of our needs. She did an excellent job. Service would get a 5 star."], ["Michelle F.", "We have been eating here forever. Love the food, atmosphere, and service. Always. This trip, for maybe the second time ever, I passed on the BBQ and instead ordered an entree, Double Delight, \u00a0from the menu. It was a great choice... Delight indeed! The veggies, shrimp and chicken were well cooked and the sauce was tangy, sweet, and spicy. It came with rice, a crab rangoon and an orange wedge. Everyone else at the table had BBQ. We all ordered soup and by the time my dining companions were coming back to the table with their BBQ, my entree was just arriving so no need to worry about timing. Can't wait to do it again!"], ["Gaby Q.", "Great atmosphere and in such a fun neighborhood. Food is always fresh and they have the best crab rangoon and hot & sour soup in KC. The cocktails I have tried are delicious. Probably one of my favorite restaurants in the area."], ["Michelle C.", "I am a huge fan of Mongolian BBQ. I like to go out to eat in groups, and this sort of restaurant is an easy way to please many types of eaters, diets, allergies, etc. The gentleman at the front who sat us was so friendly. He was very warm and inviting, and it happened to be a cold rainy day so that was a very refreshing thing to walk into. Our waitress was friendly, and very helpful. She was just enough helpful and away to not be obnoxious. I opted for the BBQ create your own bill. Loved the fact that I got soup and unlimited appetizers. I could have filled up with spring rolls before I even had a chance to get the grill. There were a couple appetizers that tasted really gross, but I was happy with the spring rolls. Not the best, but not the worse I had ever had either. I enjoyed the selection of veggies and proteins from the bbq section, and ended up with a plate that was very yummy.Here's why I can't give Genghis Khan more than 3 stars. On the menu we were given when we sat down there were 3 different prices for the bbq grill. One for vegetarian and one for meat eaters. I told her that I wanted the vegetarian grill. She said \"oh it doesn't matter its all the same price\" It was not all the same price on the menu. My vegetarian dish on the menu was $11.00. When I get my tab its $15.00. The person I was with had scallops and their bill was $17.00. An extra $2.00 for the seafood. Now if they were all the same price shouldn't their bill been the same? Not to mention the fact that my bill was $4.00 more than the menu stated. I asked, but was brushed off with some lame excuse. I really want to enjoy this place, but not cool to charge someone more than the menu states. If your prices change. Don't hand out a menu with something different on it. It isn't cool."], ["David G.", "While I'd like to review the entire menu, I always get the same thing: \u00a0The mongolian BBQ. \u00a0Unless you are from the 13th Century, you already know that a mongolian BBQ is a do-it-yourself affair in which you provide a series of ingredients and your meal is quickly saut\u00e9ed on a searing hot surface (apparently in homage to Mongolian warriors who flipped over their shields to make dinner).Unlike other late-comers, this is NOT a change and has been in the KC area for decades (although they have another location by the airport). \u00a0I've been to many other Mongolian BBQs throughout the country and this one stays my favorite for a few simple reasons.First, they have a interesting mix of ingredients to throw into your stir fry such as roasted potatoes, fried tofu and a variety of mushrooms. \u00a0The pescatarians will love the variety of seafood and ominovores will enjoy the bounty from the animal kingdom. \u00a0As a snack while you wait they've got a sesame bread, crab rangoon, and hot wings. \u00a0Great combinations abound.Second, they've got less pre-made sauces and more do it yourself variety. \u00a0A series of infused oils and waters allow you to mix up your own sauce with some handy suggestions. \u00a0No \"teriyaki\" sauce but they do have soy sauce, sugar water, and wine to make your own. A handy tip is if you want such things as minced garlic or ginger go to the infused waters and scoop from the bottom of the bowl since the juicy bits fall right to the \u00a0bottom. \u00a0I'm a total ginger lover (redheads are the bomb!)Finally, in spite of the variety of animal products, they are extremely vegan and vegetarian friendly. \u00a0Anything with animal products is clearly marked (which in Asian cooking there is often hidden shrimp and oysters). \u00a0If you pick a vegetarian bowl for your stir-fry they'll be sure to use separate utensils during the stir fry process. \u00a0Very cool. \u00a0The secret menu item for vegetarians is the delicious vegan broth with large chunks of tofu and crunchy celery and bean sprouts.The atmosphere is feels very traditional, although to be fair I've never been to China, especially China of the 13th century. \u00a0The artistic black and white photographs on the wall really do make me feel like I'm right there and the hardwood floors and lanterns are very un-western and particularly unique. \u00a0Again, this isn't a chain and it isn't about being hip here but rather quality food."], ["Abbey A.", "I love the neighborhood feel of this place, but the food has just never done it for me.

I wasn't but I must have looked confused :) She was so sweet I figured I'd just give it a try. I also am a huge fan of mongolian bbq style places. The ingredients and sauce selection are about the most limited I've ever seen but I've only been to chain places I believe so understandable. Most of the food was pretty great in the end though. My waitress was completely awesome, tall white girl with cool hair style tied up in double buns, neat eye makeup and very helpful. Everyone from the guy at the grill to what I imagine might have been the owner we so damn friendly. I couldn't say enough about the service. Prices are not super low but normal and worth it I'd say. I got some hot tea as well which was decent. The waitress offered to get me another tea but it was certainly not that bad but the offer was really nice. I'll definitely go back."], ["Baylie L.", "It doesn't get much better than choosing your own ingredients, down to the sauces and seasonings, and having it cooked for you. Genghis Khan is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City. Not only for it's food, but for the atmosphere, location, and service as well. Genghis Khan is located off 39th street in Kansas City's midtown area, right up the street from the Kansas University Medical Center. It is in a 100 year old building with a front and back entrance. Each time I've been there, I've entered through the front and was greeted immediately. It's open from lunch to dinner everyday but Sunday. It offers a dim-lighted atmosphere with soothing music at just the right volume. Genghis Khan is decorated with a variety of lights, photos, and Asian decor. Genghis Khan offers a wide selection of Asian entrees including beef, chicken, seafood, and vegetarian plates as well. It is very vegan and gluten-free friendly just ask your server on what is offered. I go there for the Mongolian BBQ so I can't offer any insight on specific entrees but I have no doubt they are delicious. I always order the All-You-Care-To-Eat Meat BBQ which is $13.50 for dinner and $11.00 for lunch. I don't eat seafood but they also offer an All-You-Care-To-Eat Seafood and Meat BBQ for $15 at dinner and $14.50 at lunch. The prices are well worth it for the meal. The bbq comes with the appetizer bar, dessert bar, and soup. You have the choice of either Hot and Sour soup or Egg Drop soup. The appetizer bar includes crab-rangoons, egg rolls, and chicken wings. On my most recent trip, the dessert bar included watermelon and brownie bites. Now for the best part, the Mongolian BBQ includes a wide variety of fresh vegetables, meats, seafood, noodles, eggs, and sauces/seasonings. Just grab a bowl, add whatever you'd like and take it to the cook to be cooked on the Hibachi grill. If you aren't sure on what sauces to use on your food they have a couple suggestions. You can also create a gluten-free sauce.On my latest visit, I ended up with only one plate before I was full. I started with a couple crab-ragoon dipped in the duck sauce they have available. I then got my entree which included: eggs, green and red bell peppers, green onions, white onions, diced potatoes, chicken, beef, egg noodles, and their suggested mild sauce. I'm not a huge veggie eater hints the lack of vegetables. It takes about 5 minutes to be cooked. Some people just stand around the grill and wait, others will take a seat until their meal is finished. With this type of meal, plate presentation doesn't matter. Since the food is cooked right there and put on a plate for you to grab, the temperature is always right. Genghis Khan also offers a full serviced bar and a two page drink menu. Although I am not of age, my boyfriend is. He ALWAYS gets their drink titled \"Red Dragon.\" It includes Midori, Triple Sec, rum, strawberry puree, cranberry, orange, and pineapple juices. It is presented well in a large cocktail glass with an orange on top, a cherry, and the famous drink umbrella. He absolutely loves the Red Dragon. The service is my ideal service. Our last server was a young woman with a clean appearance, which is always important. She wasn't overbearing at all. She checked on us just the right amount of times, not too much but not too little. She was quick to get anything we needed and cleaned up our table throughout our meal. We were nicely greeted at the door, taken to our seats, and soon after approached by our server ready to get our drinks.Overall, I thoroughly enjoy Genghis Khan and will continue eating here. It has the perfect atmosphere, delicious food, and great service. I easily give this place five stars."], ["Marie F.", "First impression is that it's pretty small... and pretty busy. \u00a0So, we ordered our drinks (mango juice is delightful, but be sure to get water as well) and fell in line. \u00a0The ingredient line is set up kinda cramped. \u00a0You can't reach all the ingredients from one side, so you gotta be bobbing and weaving to one side and the other. \u00a0The dessert cart is pushed against the wall and you have to maneuver around it as well.Most of the meat is thin and frozen. \u00a0I guess that's a safety feature so you aren't slopping meat juice into other meat vats. \u00a0This causes the meat to cook up all jerky like. \u00a0There is small sign toward the end of the meat section saying that seafood is an extra 3.99... it's about 2 inches wide and very easy to miss. \u00a0I wasn't down with all the items not being included on the buffet line. \u00a0Just didn't seem right. (The Krabmeat is not considered seafood so have at it.)The oils and sauces are not plentiful so you have to work on achieving a different flavor from your last dish. \u00a0A few of the sauces are mostly water (sugar water, ginger water). My first dish was swimming in sauces and I thought it was going to be a flavor explosion, but it was very bland. \u00a0Attempt two, I followed the \"Spicy\" guideline that is listed on the sneeze guard. \u00a0It was an improvement, but in no way spicy. \u00a0The hot and sour soup was top notch and the rangoons were generously filled \u00a0and quite good. \u00a0Their noodle selection was rice noodles, egg noodles and non egg noodles. \u00a0I do love noodles. \u00a0I don't know about that chicken wing thingy though. \u00a0It was part meat and part rock. \u00a0Chew carefully. \u00a0It's fun to experiment with the ingredients and sauces and you get to go back as much as you want. \u00a0You will definitely leave feeling full. \u00a0There is a huge price increase from lunch to dinner so plan accordingly.

I only give it 3 stars because a 3.5 star rating doesn't exist but that's where I'd really like it to be.While I'm still turned off by people handling raw meats randomly, it seemed far more sanitary than the place downtown. The meats were frozen and very thinly sliced so they'd still cook properly. Major props for doing it more correctly. They also had a larger selection of meats/seafood for those that are carnivores.The veggie selection was pretty awesome and seemed fairly fresh. Ok, I was smitten by the fact that they had two different kinds of mushrooms. And yes, I may have made myself a mushrooms-mostly dish. But seriously, the veggie selection was pretty damn good.Also, I neglected to say that they give you soup beforehand. I opted for the egg drop, which I really liked. They also have appetizers lying out, including veggie rolls, crab rangoon (though I don't think there was any crab at all in there), chicken wings and scallion pancakes. The veggie rolls were delish!All in all, I wouldn't mind coming here again. While the idea of Mongolian stir-fry doesn't really make me hot in the pants, this is my favorite of all the places I've been forced to try. I also think I want to come back in winter for one of the hot-pot options. They looked amazing!"], ["Marissa H.", "My 1st time eating Mongolian BBQ...yum.

The staff was OK... the oldest one, a lady roaming the floor was the nicest of the bunch.The crab rangoon were very good. Mini spring rolls tasty. The melon was PUUUURRRRfect.The array of ingredients was VERY good. 10 proteins by my count. I like to go vegetarian at these places so I stick to the tofu. The veggies numbered around 20 with nice additions like jalapeno, cilantro, corn, zucchini, and green onion.The spicing area had 10 sauces and three recipes... mild-medium-spicy. I had all of them and they were all good. The spicy sauce was particularly tasty. Nice additions to the norm included chipotle powder, five spice powder, Mediterranean spice, \u00a0white pepper, garlic chili paste, hot chili paste, and sesame seeds.Really... much better than most [e.g. HuHot] in terms of variety and flavor."], ["John N.", "Let me start by saying I went to Genghis Khan a few years ago and left mostly unimpressed. I remember thinking my dish turned out to be unexpectedly bland, yet it cost more than I'd expected. I knew I was probably to blame for this more than anything, though. After all, at a Mongolian grill, the diner assembles his/her own bowl of ingredients. It's only the cooking that's left up to the restaurant's staff. So when my friend Andrew asked if we had a Mongolian Barbecue in Kansas City while we were trying to think of dinner ideas Saturday night, a light bulb went off in my head. It was time to return and give this place a fair shake.Located at 39th and Bell, just south of d'Bronx, I found the dining room more inviting and cozy than I remembered it. The exposed brick walls and aged hard wood floors were exceedingly cozy and inviting. The perpetual searing and steaming of meat and veggies on the flat-topped grill dispersed an invisible fog of warmth and inviting aroma that filled our chests and piqued our dormant appetites.The friendly hostess promised us our wait would be short despite a full dining room, and she was right. After allowing me just enough time to walk back outside and capture a couple photos of the front of the building, we were seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant, which probably would have been where I'd have chosen if I was given my pick from the whole place. Great spot. The window on my left looked out over the insanely busy parking lot behind the restaurant, and to my right were the rest of the diners, happy, raucously conversing and laughing. It had that sense of universal contentment throughout.In no time we were back out of our seats and loading woefully small bowls with our raw ingredients. I was slightly disappointed that so many were over-cooled and frozen, but it was better than the (health code violating) alternative of an overly warm buffet line. So just a minor infraction. Into my bowl I hurriedly piled sliced mushrooms, cabbage, jalapeno, cilantro, carrots, bean sprouts, water chestnuts and thin slices of celery. I was positively thrilled with the veggie choices on hand.On top of the veg I piled delightfully yellow egg noodles - a modest portion though my egg noodle-crazy appetite screamed at me to double, nay triple the amount I first took. On top of the noodles I added thinly sliced raw pork and delicious looking bright white squid segments from the protein selections, and if you like squid don't miss out. I loved having it in my dish.Following the recipe for a spicy sauce, I ladled into my bowl a base of liquids including, but not limited, to soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar water, ginger water, garlic and some kind of chili paste. Truthfully, I can't remember what-all was involved, but the ingredients are listed for the convenience of confused diners on the sneeze guard above the bowls. [I remembered that on my last trip, the sauce component was where I thought I had failed... my dish had turned out bland and dry, Confused by the myriad of sauce choices in front of me and not cognizant of the recipe listed literally right under my nose, I limited my selection to a single inadequate ladle of soy sauce. More experienced in Asian cooking now (\"experienced\" used lightly here), this omission of flavored liquids seems preposterous and somewhat embarrassing.]The final ingredient choice to diners after saucing is that of egg or no. I elected to add it - an essential to stir fry of any kind in my mind.Then I stood back and what the two grill masters quickly but expertly sautee my ingredients to perfection. Truly, their method of quick-searing and then spreading out the ingredients to ensure meats are in direct contact with the grill so as to cook through, is carried out with a good amount of skill. I was beyond eager to dig in when they handed my steaming bowl of flat top bbq back to me.A quick stop to the dessert and sides table in the middle of the floor for a crab rangoon and fried spring roll and then we ceased communication in lieu of face down, hog-to-trough style food inhalation. I may not have even used my fork. It's hard to remember.What I do remember is that I'd nailed the sauce and ingredients. The whole dish was fiendishly salty and spicy. The squid was nicely chewy, but not overcooked tot the point of rubberiness. The pork had picked up a lot of flavor from the sauces and packed more color and flavor than I'd expected. The water chestnuts and celery added a woody, nutty crunch I loved, almost like croutons in a lettuce salad. My noodles were incredibly fresh tasting, also chewy but rich and soft, too. Altogether, a fantastic plateful of ingredients bursting and popping off each other with flavor and texture differences that played like a fireworks show in my mouth.We'd hit the nail on the head, here. The right restaurant for the type of appetite and mood we all had at that moment in time.Price is buffet-high, but okay. Great stuff all in all."], ["Tim M.", "It's past due for me to update, since the manager contacted me and assured me all of the sauces/oils are MSG-free except two. Don't remember which two, but even if you happen to use them, you will be getting very little of it amongst the mix. Good place with obviously attentive management. I say, try it. I always leave satisfied."], ["Christina M.", "This place is amazing. My family and I always choose this particular grill because it is BY FAR the best Mongolian Grill. You definitely need to call ahead for this place though, its quite small. I have eaten at BD's Mongolian Grill, the Mongolian Grill on Main St and the location in Overland Park, none of them hold a candle to the location on Bell St. This particular location has a lot going for it. It is near the KU Med campus, is located near several other great restaurants (Blue Koi Noodles & Dumplings, Po's Dumpling Bar, Friends Sushi) and Prospero's Books is just down the street. Its location is also on a narrow, crowded residential street which means that parking can sometimes be an issue. They have a parking lot around the back of the restaurant, but it is shared with another restaurant. Your best bet for a wonderful experience is the lunch buffet. I have only gone to Genghis Khan's for dinner once and I wasn't that impressed. The lunch buffet is definitely the way to go, just try and miss the crowd!The buffet is a sprawling array of ingredients and includes meats (chicken, pork, beef), seafood (oysters, squid, crab, shrimp), vegetables (carrots, broccoli, peppers, onions, spinach, tomatoes, snow peas, zucchini, cabbage, sprouts, water chestnuts etc..), mushrooms, different kinds of noodles, and a variety of toppings (sesame seeds, peanuts, sliced almonds, etc..). ***Before you grab a bowl, however, you should know that the two colors of bowls are for different dietary requirements (vegetarian and non-vegetarian). Make sure to read the sign above the bowls so you know which one you are taking.***As you are filling your bowl, keep in mind that a lot of it will cook down. If you want a lot of greens (spinach, peppers, sprouts, onions etc..) make sure that you load up on those. \u00a0After you have your ingredients, you will move on to the sauces. They have laminated cards that guide you through fairly neutral sauce combinations (keep in mind that sesame oil is a natural laxative, so don't douse your creation in it). Depending on how much spice you can handle, there are jars you can top your ingredients with at the very end of the buffet.If you want a fried egg, there is an ice bath of eggs near the grill. Just place your egg on your plate, you don't have to crack it yourself (I have seen people do this).There is also a tip jar on the grillers counter, we normally give a tip to the last person in out group to go through the line, that way they tip for all of us. Once your food has seen the grill and you are back at your table, try the appetizers/sides that they have near the center of the room. They normally have fresh fruit, crab Rangoon, sesame breads (these are my favorite), soup (sweet & sour and egg drop). The desserts are also located here. The Rangoon's go fast, so assign someone to watch for new batches. They have some really great cocktails, I would suggest trying their pear sangria as it is AMAZING.TL;DR TIPS:-Bathroom is small and there is normally a bit of a wait for it-Make sure you read what the ingredients are before you take them-If you are allergic to nuts be careful-Call ahead for large groups-Assign one person to \"Rangoon Lookout\" as they go fast-DON'T USE TOO MUCH SESAME OIL-If you don't know what sauces to use, try a tried and true recipe on the laminated card-Check the bowls to make sure you have/don't have the vegetarian bowl"], ["Christian H.", "This is one of my wife and I's favorite place to go and eat at.

The restaurant had a great atmosphere and a good amount of comfortable seating. \u00a0Our waitress was prompt and although there were many delicious items on the menu, I was definitely there to try the grill and build my own meal.

We ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crispy Honey Chicken. The crispy honey chicken tasted like rubber and was inedible. A manager came by and was very nice and sent the dish back to the kitchen to be remade. Our waitress must have thought she wasn't getting a good tip after the entree mishap because she hardly stopped by our table to see if we needed anything. They made the chicken again and it was a little better but still nowhere near how good the PF Chang's are on the west coast. They at least took it off of our bill.

I had asked my waiter how their fall special was and he said he loved it (typical answer to which I did not appreciate) it was the Vietnamese steak and shrimp. The description said it was their take on Pho and it was stir fried. I was expecting some kind of lomein/Singapore noodle style stir fried and when I got it, I was a little confused. It looked like a five year old had cooked it. It def was stir fried. It looked and tasted like they put the sauce on the plate, boiled the noodles and stirred it for a little bit and put old cilantro on top. I was not a fan. Mom had the chang's spicy chicken and she didn't like it either. It was dry and boring. Our friend had the shanghai shrimp and garlic to which he didn't enjoyed also. He said the sauce was too thick. The snow peas were not snapped at each end so you get that membrane at the kind where it can be very disgusting to eat. I've worked and been into a lot of Asian rest and all the green beans and snow peas are properly cleaned and snapped at both ends to make for a better eating experience.

The chicken was of a poor quality and even though I asked for it extra spicy, it barely registered. The batter on the chicken was soggy before I had bite one.

I don't usually eat dessert when I go out to eat, but their great wall of chocolate is fantastic -- chocolate cake with fresh fruit and this really tasty raspberry sauce. Yum! And since it was free for us that night, it tasted even better. I used to eat here constantly when I was living on campus and could walk to the plaza, but now that I'm back in Independence I still make time to stop by here when I can, especially on special occasions, because they take good care of their customers here."], ["Christyn K.", "There probably isn't a PF Changs within a 500 mile radius in California that I hadn't visited before I moved to KC. That said, I expected some pretty stellar service and food in par with previous experiences. Three of us arrived late afternoon the day after Christmas, surprised to see such a crowd though grateful there was still some bar seating left. After sitting at the bar for awhile, we had to flag down the waiter to finally give us a menu, stating that we were told we could order food and drinks at the bar (which would, of course, up his tip, too!). Trying to be friendly, I ordered a bar just to play by the bar rules, though asked him if we could sit at a table we spotted by the window. He gave some sort of muffled answer and walked away... and when he didn't return for an exaggerated amount of time, we finally went back to the hostess' stand and asked HER if we could move since it was still considered bar seating. After that our waiter changed completely with no explanation. Whatever - I wasn't going to let that stop me from enjoying my food -- which was as good as any I have ever ordered at PFC's (Peanut Curry Veggies with Brown Rice). Our veggie potstickers were OK, my drink was stiff yet only $6 thanks to the Happy Hour menu, and the others in my group ate and enjoyed their food. It was clear while we ate that the line to get in the joint was growing, and it became clearer to me then that this is one of the smallest PFChangs I have ever seen. Glad we dodged that bullet. Overall, the crappy staff & small interior dock my rating two stars, though I really, really do love the food, the semi-affordable menu, and energy of the place (don't think I mentioned it - but I lived in China and prefer PF Chang's food - is that so wrong?)."], ["Kev L.", "This palce bores me for way too many resons.1) SUPER OVERRATED.2) Rice sucks.3) Entrees all suck.4) Staff is snooty and unless you are dressed in all Gucci (for some stupid reason) you are treated like trash.5) The wait is insane.The ONLY thing that is worth eating here is the lettuce wraps.

BIG mistake. \u00a0 The experience I had was an embarrassment to the whole group of Bo Lings restaurants. \u00a0We showed up for a late lunch, say ~1.30pm. \u00a0We were seated and after sitting there for about 15 minutes without anyone acknowledging we existed, we got up and went back to the hostess to ask why we hadn't been seen or given any waters. \u00a0She seems oblivious and confused that we were even there...When we finally got a server to come over, we got a nice long speech about how many other things she had to get done (clearly things that were more important than serving us???... if you can't figure out how to serve people, just don't seat them in your restaurant). \u00a0We placed our entire order for fear that we would never get out unless we did. \u00a0The wait began...While waiting, we noticed the couple next to us get some SUPER burnt dumplings. \u00a0(WHY ARE YOU SERVING BURNT PRODUCTS?!!) \u00a0They took a few bites but couldn't escape the overwhelming burnt flavor and signaled the waiter for help. \u00a0They explained that they wanted them brought back to which the waiter didn't seem to know what to do. \u00a0He ran off over to the bar to get what I would guess was the manager. \u00a0She looked over the dumplings, the couple had to re-explain the problem (...not sure why it was hard to tell what was wrong), then the manager did the one of the biggest no-no in the dining industry - she argued with the customer about the dumplings, asking them if they could just eat the few of them that weren't completed torched :/ ... After a few more minutes of explaining that they would not eat the dumplings (that frankly shouldn't have made it out of the kitchen), the manager finally took them back to the kitchen.We received our crab rangoon fairly soon after ordering. \u00a0They were very well cooked! (yey! ~ five stars for that one...) \u00a0Shortly after we got our bowls of egg drop soup. \u00a0They were also great. \u00a0We asked the server if she could bring us some more crispy wonton chips to complement our soup. \u00a0She nodded ... I assumed that meant we would get some... but no. \u00a0After waiting and waiting, we finally found someone else to ask and FINALLY got some more wonton chips after our Lo Mein had arrived and most of my party was down to the final few bites of soup.All in all, this experience was as I described, like watching a train wreck slowly happening. \u00a0I love the Bo Lings brand and make it a point to go back every time I visit Kansas City but will say that next time I go back, I will drive out of my way to go the the 9055 Metcalf location (or maybe even the Plaza location) and NEVER go back to this location at the Zona Rosa shopping center.Things to improve on:- greeting customers well before 15 minutes after they have been seated- not serving burnt food- not arguing with customers when they don't want to eat your burnt food- training staff and managers how to handle situations where customers have questions or concerns about your food- training your waiters not to complain to customers about all of their problems- training your staff to actually follow through on getting things for customers when they say they will go get them.The pros from this trip:- Hot, well cooked, fresh crab rangoons- Bo Lings is great (just not at this location)"], ["Lisa I.", "This Bo Lings location is poorly managed, with incredibly terrible service, as well as having a lack of quality in their food service.

I had to walk to the front and ask about service. I was told they forgot to tell the waiters about our table. Once they did whatever they needed to do on their computer system, a waitress came over. And, that is when the real disaster began. With no oversight, management put a new trainee at our table. She put out appetizer plates, then after waiting another 16 minutes, she brought water and started taking up the plates. We had ordered soup and needed the plates for the wonton crackers and sauce that was brought after the plates were taken away. We had no napkins and no plates or anything for the wontons. At this point, I got up again and discreetly asked to speak with the manager. It was our waitress who was back there and when she did get the manager, I kindly asked her to stay. I explained the different parts of the situation and said I didn't want the waitress or front desk personnel \u00a0to feel badly, nor did I want to embarrass my family, but we needed to get some service to salvage our experience there. The manager said she understood and asked me to give my suggestions for how things could be better and help with the training understanding of her employees. We spoke about things like still needing napkins and silverware. The manager brought out napkins and at that moment our soup and entire meal arrived together. We asked for the food to be taken back so we could enjoy our appetizer soup. The manager asked if we wanted it to be kept warm. We said we wanted it rather to be made fresh. She agreed and said she would speak with the chef personally. So, after she left, we then sat there with our soup........and, no spoons. The waitress finally brought some. Still, no one had anything to put the sauce on for the wontons as the plates had been taken. Then, we waited AFTER our soup was done for another 12 minutes for our meal. It came, and we sat there for 4 more minutes for.......you guessed it! - forks. And, another 3 minutes for serving spoons. I got up again and asked for those. The waitress brought them .....4, then another 2. Then, the serving spoons -- 3, then 2. To top off a spectacular dining experience, there is no way the food was made fresh. The Beef Chow Fun was lukewarm with dry noodles; the Pad Thai was warm; the Sesame Chicken was cold; the rice was crispy --- so crispy around the edges that some large amounts of the rice were literally impossible to bite. Really. Only the Vegetable Fried Rice and Tofu Family Style was acceptable and as they should be. For this (un)lovely two hour experience we got to spend near $100, spoke with the manager four times and were told sorry with stale almond cookies that were surely processed in some faraway factory three years ago \u00a0(the oil in them was so rancid even my two dogs wouldn't eat them.) All this transpired with us being calm, kind, and professional. And, I do appreciate the manager being professional and courteous. I waited 15 more minutes after our party left to speak with her and discuss that paying the full bill was wrong to ask of us for such a disappointing experience. She attempted to speak with the owner, and failing to be able to do so, was only able to give us 20% off our bill....oh, and those hideous almond cookies I mentioned. I appreciated her attempt. I REALLY don't like to be negative or leave a poor review. But, this is part of why Yelp exists. I do want to mention the excellent service of the lady who brought out the food, and the two ladies who cleared the table. They were friendly and competent.Oh, what is that you ask??

I'm a big fan of spiced lamb and lamb meat in general, but this dish was especially disappointing. Unexpectedly, the dish was breaded, and some pieces seemed more breading that lamb itself. The dish was also extremely saucy, which means the flavor of the spices and lamb were completely concealed. I could have been eating beef, chicken, or cardboard, and with that much sauce, I wouldn't have noticed the difference. Sadly, the string beans were probably the best. Which isn't saying much.

They have a wide range of dishes from a standard fried rice, generals chicken, Pad Thai all the way to beef tendon, pork buns, chicken feed and turnip cakes.I almost always try to get 1 plate of dim sum while I'm there to try something new. Most recently I tried the turnip cake which was actually quite lovely. It's shaped like a piece of cake but it made with soft turnips and fried to a light golden color in a pan. It also has a shrimp flavor to it. Its somewhat of a fishy dish but still very good and not too heavy on the stomach although it is dense and hot.My other favorite is probably the Beef Chow fun when I feel like some noodles. Strips of beef mixed with a thick dark sauce and very thick strips of noodles. This is always a solid go to dish for me along with the Pad Thai.I haven't had a bad dish at Bo Ling's yet. I've even done the thing where I order something that I have no idea what it is. It ended up being thin bean noodles topped with ground beef and a dark sauce.

Beef Chow Fun. It's delicious and fun to say! The only negative they get is the AWFUL bathroom setup. It's technically not even in their business, as they share it with Winlows and Blue Nile. I'm sure this is something they couldn't work around, part of doing business in the City Market.

I was full before I had any fresh stir-fry from the mongolian grill. The spring rolls were crispy and delicious. I wish there were at least some authentic chinese food options. Maybe some chicken feet or tripe would be nice for those who crave dim-sum. Our server didn't say much to us, but she did clear dishes promptly. The host was very nice and inviting.

The lunch menu is very affordale - most entrees are $5-$6 and include fried rice and either crab ran goon or egg roll. I almost always order egg drop soup, but I just had chinese food for lunch yesterday (from a different restaurant) and wasn't satisfied with it, so I decided to order the hot and sour soup. Usually hot & sour is too sour for me and I don't care for it - This was easily THE BEST hot and sour soup I've ever had. It was spicy enough to create a nice slow burn, and I could see the red pepper flakes in the broth. Delicious!The crab ran goon was unlike any I've ever had. It was super creamy and cheesier than any I've had before. It almost looked like there could have been some mozzarella in it because when you pulled it apart, the cheese stretched a bit. I know that sounds weird for crab ran goon, but it was so good! They use the thicker won ton wrappers here for their ran goons. The egg rolls used the thin wrappers and they were good, not too much pepper like many places, but I would order the crab ran goon over the egg rolls any day.My szechwan chicken was very good. The vegetables were crispy and the sauce was flavorful. I like that they included zucchini in the veggies. I was full from the soup and the appetizers, so I took most of my entree to go. My cousin wasn't thrilled with her Sweet & Sour Pork. She said everything tasted \"burned.\" I tasted it and I'm pretty certain that the burned flavor was sesame oil.

I love this place!"], ["A P.", "Very good Chinese food in a storefront restaurant. Good quality, freshly made. Sweet couple runs the place. I agree with Ken that you don't want to eat there -- rickety, old booths. However, the food is the best Chinese I've found in the Northland."], ["Ken M.", "It's not expensive or fancy, but the food tastes good. More tham a few times we have been comped soup with our meal. Note: this is NOT a place I like to eat in, but we love the take out."]]}
