Still can't do the raw fish thing, but I'm learning. The California roll is good, the Spanish roll is even better, and today's special New Moon roll (smoked salmon, crab, cream cheese, jalape\u00f1o slice) took me from tolerating somebody else's choice of cuisine to actual enjoyment. I always thought sushi was expensive for what you get, but after a 2-roll & soup lunch special and splitting the New Moon with Yelper Daughter, I was stuffed (can't tell you how much it was, because YD has at last reached the age where she's picking up some lunch tabs)!The restaurant is clean and bright, our server was nice, and if it took a little while for the food to arrive, it was beautifully presented and worth waiting for. And the background music-remember Super Q104, anybody? Fabulous!"], ["Amy A.", "I came very hungry on a Tuesday night at 6:45. It was the only sushi place I found in the area and since the reviews were mixed, I thought I'd try my luck. I ordered miso soup, a California roll and 4 pieces of salmon. Nothing crazy since I haven't eaten here before. I posted a photo. The wasabi was brownish and hard, not fresh at all. The California roll was ok, but the salmon had a weird shine like it was not fresh. It tasted good, but still a little worried. The miso soup tasted not right as well like something was not fresh. The service was marginal. I was going to try the green tea ice cream and the waitress just brought me the bill. I decided not to bother. I would not recommend. Also, no alternative to soy sauce for those of us with wheat allergies."], ["Laura B.", "Worst experience ever. Do not go here! Literally had dirt in my food. The vegetables weren't washed. When I showed the server she said she would handle it. Her handling it was taking $5 off my meal. So I ate dirt, and she took off $5. The chef would not come out to speak to me, and no manager on site. Disgusted."], ["Mike M.", "Average sushi and service."], ["David W.", "Good sushi in Liberty, clean up to date restaurant, very good menu, The service is ok but servers just about everywhere are not as good as they used to be.

I will be back many more times"], ["Courtney L.", "I really really enjoyed the sushi here, but that may have also been because I had to shovel it into my mouth.The service here is so very slow. It took forever to get menus, to get water, to order, and forever and a half for the food to come out. The waitress was incredibly inattentive for us being one of 3 tables occupied and from our seats we could see the sushi chefs. It looked like they were literally in slow motion. This wouldn't be a problem as much during dinner, but we were here for lunch. We had work we needed to get back to and it took an hour and 30 minutes, not to mention travel time.But despite all that, I'm still giving 3 stars. I loved the sushi here and I loved the prices. During lunch hours they have a special with 2 FULL-sized rolls and soup for $9.99. I ordered the Mango Tuna (regularly $9.50) and the Computer Roll (reg. $9.50). And yes, they were full-sized! I really enjoyed both rolls and was really really happy with the price. You can't beat that!! Sushi is even more expensive at Price Chopper! A co-worker also ordered the Sashimi Salad... which was spicy and basically just chopped raw fish piled together with dressing. SO good. Spicy, but really good. That was $12.95 (not on lunch special). I will definitely return here for lunch, but only on a day that my boss isn't in the office."], ["Tyra W.", "Please note this review only reflects their service and restaurant hygiene because I did not stick around for the food. It was a \"seat yourself\" Saturday. After gazing around the place we noticed (I kid you not) EVERY table was dirty in the restaurant except for one where a family was eating. Food, crumpled napkins, and silverware was strung about across tabletops. Upon becoming increasingly hesitant, we forced ourselves to sit at the bar (which was half dirty as well). We received no service after being acknowledged and 15 mins later of sitting, a guy finally came over with menus and it took another 10 mins for water. The cook looked like he wanted to jump thru the windows. He literally just stood staring mindlessly out the window completely motionless. As far as cleanliness, I really don't understand how you can be THAT lazy to not clean a single table or two here and there when you have no business and clearly you are FAR from busy! Needless to say, this place was screaming why it was empty during prime dining hours on the weekend."], ["Greg S.", "Love this place! Their sushi is pretty good quality, and it's competitively priced. Service has been good every time I have been there (sometimes a bit slow but not bad). I really wish they would do a half price sushi happy hour. I would come in everyday if they had that! Also, the restaurant has always been clean when I've gone in.Start a 1/2 price sushi happy hour and I'd be there much more frequently!"], ["Maria T.", "Methinks not is right!!! Moonlight earned the not so honorable 1 star review, and my first 1 star! So congrats Moonlight, I finally gave a restaurant 1 star, unfortunately you guys were it. Please note the 1 star is purely on the sushi/food (I apologize in advance for those who are Moonlight fans but this review could get ugly and feelings may get hurt, reader discretion is advise!!). Decided to order takeout as it was closer to my house than my usual sushi joint Wasabi, and it was easier to call in as they had the menu online. I like to consider myself as a sushi snob, I've worked at a sushi restaurant for 2 years so I know a thing or 2 about it. When I thought I'd seen it all as far as sushi goes, never did I thought I was going to get F grade sushi. Moonlight exceeded that expectation for me. I've dined at many sushi locations in the KC area as well as throughout the country and this place was horrible.Ordered the Monkey Roll (salmon, avocado, cream cheese deep fried), salmon sashimi (2pcs), spicy salmon and a spicy crab salad. Can I just say heart attack with the Monkey Roll? Cream cheese overload! There were more cream cheese in that one roll than the salmon itself. The spicy salmon roll....not spicy nor did it taste fresh at all. I gagged each time I ate a piece. Salmon sashimi....I could have bought grade C sushi at the grocery store and it'd still be fresher than that. The color was off, texture was more slimy and mushy than it should have been. I normally finish my sushi but this time could only finish half. Had to build the stomach strength to get through as much as I could since I did not want to waste $30 worth of sushi. Spicy crab salad was a joke. I use to work at a sushi restaurant that serves it...I know my spicy crab salad, this was not it. It was dry, lacked in flavor, way too much tempura, the seaweed had a funky taste to it and the imitation crab meat was beyond dry. Disappointment at it's best. This tainted my sushi crave unfortunately. They fooled me with the pretty presentation, shame on them.I will say the service was decent, they were nice and friendly also even got low sodium soy sauce. Too bad it wasn't enough to at least bump up to a 2 star in my book. I will not cheat on Wasabi again with this sushi wannabe restaurant! That extra 5min drive is more worth it than this place!"], ["April M.", "Always great service and while I'm not a huge sushi eater, they have a great selection to appeal to all tastes."], ["G G.", "Good fresh food prepared with customer oriented people. Great for the northland. Unlike a lees summit restaurant version of sushi, this is very good and can recommend."], ["Faith B.", "Yummy sushi, but you will rack up a big bill. BIG. FAST.Tasty crab salad and the calamari got raves.BF got a teriyaki dish and said it was just average. He took most of it home and then didn't bother eating the leftovers.The service was friendly and warm.I far prefer Fuji in Liberty though. The prices are less frightening and the sushi is just as good, if not better."], ["Elizabeth D.", "This place is great local SUSHI at it's best. LOVE the Moonlight Roll and will be back for sure."], ["Tania M.", "Just an \"OK\" sushi place. \u00a0We had issues finding seating because nothing was clean and at first we were sat at a tabled that wobbled like crazy, but moved ourselves very quickly. \u00a0I ordered a Blue Hawaiian alcoholic drink (something like that) and the drink was heavily, heavily watered down, so if you get drinks here, expect to get two or three. \u00a0I just wanted to try it, so I didn't get more than one. \u00a0The Moonlight Roll was very good, but the Spicy Tuna Roll was not spicy and barely tuna. \u00a0We ordered a couple more rolls that had shrimp in them, and the outer shell of the shrimp was still on, which made it difficult to eat. \u00a0Personally, I don't like eating the crispy part of shrimp, so we had to attempt to get the shell off ourselves, and the rolls almost fell apart in the process. \u00a0Miso soup was okay but nothing spectacular either, and the rolls were very loosely rolled and kept falling apart. \u00a0We were only here because there was no room to eat at Seva (Indian restaurant next door) but probably won't stop in again as we have a much nicer sushi place (Mr. Le's Sushi) that is not far away from us."], ["Harry P.", "Sushi in the Midwest.... I've gotta admit, it ain't half bad. The Misses and I have been here a few times now and while we can't get the variety of rolls we would in other cities we've lived, you can't beat the price. The food is fresh, the restaurant is clean, and while the service can be a bit slow, the food more than makes up for it."], ["Shawn V.", "I've always found this to be a very consistent Sushi restaurant in the Northland. It is not my favorite in Kansas City, but it certainly beats a 45 minute drive. The owners are very nice and always seem to do nice things for regulars.The wait staff I have always found to be very courteous and attentive.As with most Sushi restaurants, Tuesdays and Fridays are when the receive their fish shipments. Stay close to these days for your freshest fare!"], ["Sarah M.", "Let me start by saying that this place has been a long-time favorite of mine. The rolls are delicious. I have never been too impressed with the decor or the music, but that's not why I come here. The last few times I've been here, it seems dirtier and dirtier. I am here now, and as I look around, I am mildly disgusted. There is a layer of dust on the potted silk plants sitting right above my table. The windows need a cleaning badly. Our table was sticky and we had to ask the server to clean it. There are crumbs all over the floor and surrounding \"clean\" tables. This place has delicious food. But...I'm sad to say that this may be my last visit. When you are spending big bucks for the food, you expect cleanliness at the very least. It's a shame. I'm pretending it's only the dining room that is filthy, and not the kitchen."], ["Tricia H.", "I live near Moonlight so it's one of our go to sushi places. The prices are a little high but it's very fresh fish and very good. There are so many good rolls to choose from but you definitely should try the specials on the board :-) Make sure you try the crab salad it is sooooo yummy!! I tend to stay away from the tempura rolls a little too saucy, if you do like saucy ask for a side of the Margarita sauce my daughter loves it....get out of your normal habit and try some of the fresh fish you won't be disappointed, I didn't realize how awesome fresh scallops are!! Oh and save some room for the green tea ice cream it is so refreshing Love it!!!"], ["Susan N.", "I was in the area and ended up here based on past reviews saying the sushi was very fresh. I opted for the lunch special of two rolls (dynamite and spicy tuna) and a miso soup. Plus I ordered nigri salmon - my bar for fresh sushi.First off, service was awesome. I initially didn't think it would be but the waiters that worked there were really nice and on top of their game. The miso soup came out and it was fine. A few minutes later my sushi order came out.I don't know. Fresh? Maybe other reviewers meant KC suburban fresh? Or maybe it's just gone downhill since they've opened. Either way, I didn't feel like the sushi I ate was any fresher than most other places I've been to in the metro area, which is to say, not terribly fresh at all.The tuna didn't taste like anything in particular but I did like that it was actually mildly spicy. Sometimes it's just not. The only flavor I got was a spicy mayo with random fish flavor. The dynamite really disappointed. It tasted so similar to the spicy roll, despite having several types of fish in it. If I were blindfolded, I would have never known what fish I was eating.By no means was this place's fish funky or even nasty smelling; it's just not super fresh. Average by KC standards. If this place was on the coast, it may have warranted two stars at most. The service was great but not enough to warrant me going back."], ["Noel P.", "The monkey roll not only looked amazing when it came out but there was so much I had enough to take home.Their original dressing is my favorite and I love how it tastes I could eat lots of it. Also their dumplings were the bomb and it was enough to fill me up before my sushi ever came out. I will more than likely come here again!!"]], "Bob Wasabi Kitchen": [["Katie G.", "The staff are warm and inviting. Wonderful example of quality customer service you don't see anywhere anymore!! The sushi seemed fresh and was very good. My husband and I happened upon this place as we were in town for a getaway weekend and my husband enjoys sushi, this was a wonderful local gem, worth the short trip from the Plaza district (5 mins or so), you won't be disappointed!

Which is pretty much everywhere, but my coworker opted for Japanese.I took a Yelper's suggestion to try the gyoza, and have to say, not impressed. I like gyoza and similar dumplings quite a lot. The richness and depth of the umami taste when done well is amazing. Or it can be soggy and bland.Didn't try their sushi. The miso soup was fine.

I will go back there just for that. Sooo good! \u00a0I also ordered a spicy tuna roll (a theme is developing, yes?) and it was also great. Near the end of our lunch, our dining space was invaded by honeybees. I don't mind sharing, but it was kind of crazy there for a minute, with bees swarming all around us. No big deal, and I will definitely be back."], ["Wes M.", "My wife and I eat sushi almost weekly and we usually like trying new places every time but the sushi here is the best we've ever had!

Disclaimer: I did not have sushi, which is obviously a major component of a Japanese restaurant, so I cannot speak to its quality or value.Our group of 4 arrived during a busy Friday night, but were immediately seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant, which is cozy with themed decor. The ambiance is appropriate, but not luxurious. Things were going well until the extremely long wait for our food. Even accounting for the fact that it was a full house it took what seemed to be an eternity for our food to come out of the tiny kitchen. Furthermore, the plates that were ready first were set in the service area, not under a heat source. This means that if your dish happens to be the first to be plated it will likely sit and get cold until the remainder of the tables dishes are prepared. Once we did receive our food is was average at best. The Shrimp Tempura Bowl had literally 2 pieces of shrimp. C'mon man. And the Udon noodles were a little chewy. The Domo Bowl was tasty, my only complaint is that the beef was stringy. Long story short, it took forever to receive mediocre food. Nothing else about Domo makes me feel compelled to give it another shot."], ["Jerice A.", "Love the seafood here. Sushi chefs are Japanese which is always a plus. Service is a little slow but super friendly! Love their crab salad and their shrimp tempura roll."], ["Cass B.", "Should have never given it a second try. First visit the restaurant had one other table on a Sunday evening and it took over 30 minutes to be served some of the worst sushi I've ever eaten in my life. It was a mushy mess. Not even refills on drinks. Second visit decided I wouldn't try the sushi. Wasn't my choice to come back. Ordered Garlic Shrimp. Based on the description I was hoping for a tastebud delight. Instead I received a bunch of breaded shrimp covered in honey and sesame seeds. Not a trace of \u00a0garlic. The owner refused to do anything to compensate or trade out the disgustingly sweet, unhealthy dish. He insisted his business is not in the business of doing \"samples!\" What in the hell? The gummy shrimp was an entirely misleading menu item. He refused to change the dish or take it off the bill. I will never lower my standards again. Not coming back to this substandard establishment. I wish I could give it negative stars."], ["Samantha A.", "4-stars for food. 2-stars for atmosphere. The restaurant has a weird smell & the decor/seating/cleanliness could use improvement. But, the sushi is the best that I've had so far in KC."], ["Scott T.", "A mostly pleasant dining spot with interesting but somewhat inconsistent food and service which seems to be bit of a consensus among reviewers.We arrived as a party of three with a 6:30 reservation. I let my daughter and wife out and sought out parking as the area was packed on a Friday night and the weather \u00a0cold. When I arrived 3-5 minutes later they were seated, each with a water glass in front of them, but mine missing. First clue of the evening. Whoever seated us didn't communicate the party size to the server. In fact, throughout the night I failed to see anyone I could identify as in charge of wait staff. However, at the moment it wasn't (and isn't) a big deal.Took a few minutes for the server to get by to ask for our drink orders but they were promptly delivered. We ordered appetizers, shrimp gyoza and ginger chicken. Miso soup was brought to the table as part of our dinner order and my wife and I agreed, one of the best bowls in recent memory. Truly outstanding. The ginger chicken followed with a dipping sauce. Where's the ginger taste? Lacked seasoning and looked like a plate of chicken nuggets with one small piece of parsley as garnish. Whole meat, not ground (parts) and breaded. Near the end I found a lone chunk of ginger that made it into the batter by itself. Sadly, the best part of the dish. I really don't understand the point of this selection and it clearly didn't hit the mark. Disappointing after such a spectacular bowl of miso.A sushi/sashimi boat with an extra side order of spicy octopus nigiri (always a favorite) was ordered as the entree for all to split. It arrived fairly prompt maybe 15 minutes later but we inquired what had happened to the shrimp gyoza? \"It's on its way,\" we were told. It arrived after completion of the meal. Presentation was beautiful, the rice and fish were all delicious, no complaints. Spicy octopus is typically mixed with remnants of tempura batter and then mixed with a spicy sauce (typically sriracha based). The texture, the octopus and the heat make a great combination. This was simply bits of the animal with a bit of sauce, but little kick. Another disappointment. We were wondering about the gyoza and they did finally arrive. We were ready to be let down. Gyoza in most restaurants are simply out of the bag and heated up. Still like them but why not fresh? Well, these were fresh and they were spectacular. But why deliver at the end of the meal with no apology or acknowledgement. Strange.Domo has a management problem to my eye. Our family has eaten a hell of a lot of sushi as a trio and there was a visible lack of cohesion in the front and back of the house on this Friday night. Our server was very pleasant but was clearly covering too many tables by herself and was visibly stressed.This could be a great space but needs updating. It's crowded, noisy and the tables are arranged to maximize seating, not serve the customer's comfort. Although we had a enjoyable meal we were perplexed by the experience. It's not a bad place to dine but there are 2-3 sushi venues in Lawrence far better vs. driving 45 minutes for this."], ["Brandon M.", "Disappointed. Frequent here often but the fish quality is seeming to slip. The sushi was warm today and smelled fishy. The rice was tasteless and rolls were not worth ordering...despite knowing our dissatisfaction, nothing was done about it. $50 down the drain.

Since my husband has moved to Kansas City, we have been on a hunt for a sushi restaurant, but alas, I am feeling like it is a great white buffalo-- a mythical creature that doesn't exist in KC. And, believe me, I am not some West Coast snob that doesn't believe sushi exists outside of the coasts-- I have indeed had GREAT sushi in the Midwest-- unfortunately it is not at DOMO. Here is out experience:1. My husband's meal arrived 30 minutes prior to my sushi rolls. 2. Fish was bland/ tasteless. Canned fish taste better than this. 3. Service is horrible and takes FOREVER. 4. Cuts of fish in the cherashi are uneven. I got two slices of really bad salmon, three pieces of tuna, and one piece of some type of tuna...seriously... this is worst than sushi apprentices. 5. Place wasn't even crowded, and yet the waitress and service was super rude. IDK... maybe it was an off day, but I know I will never go here again.

Full disclosure, this review is probably biased since Domo reminds me so much of my favorite Japanese place back in FL. Everything from the duo behind the counter to the menu was a throwback.

Service was friendly and attentive, even though they seemed pretty slammed.The big thing that caught me here was the menu for cooked foods.

While Domo does cater to American tastes, they also have some great authentic dishes and sushi. The fish is of a high quality and the flavor palette is right on. They serve up some excellent tempura, and while I was slightly disappointed to see them serve their tendon (tempura and noodle bowl) American style (tempura on the side, not in the soup), it was easy enough for me to remedy the situation myself. On other occasions I've tried the Las Vegas roll, Domo roll, spicy tuna roll, sake nigiri and enjoyed their perfectly prepared unagi. I've yet to encounter anything I don't like, and I'm super excited to see that they have okonomiyaki on the menu, which is incredibly difficult to find in the US. The one negative is that they don't have matcha salt- the true litmus test of a sushi restaurant.The atmosphere is sweet and very Brookside, and the staff is helpful and friendly. Definitely a KC favorite."], ["Alee H.", "I placed a take-out order and literally just got home with it, opened it up and am disgusted. When I called to place my order of an order of teriyaki chicken and one Las Vegas roll, the lady said it would be a 30 minute wait because the sushi roll would take 30 minutes to make.. okay, that's fine. Anyways, I arrive home after picking up my food, starving, open up my food and immediately lost my appetite. First of all, the sushi looked like it took 5 minutes to make, not 30 minutes and had a horrible smell to it. I ate one piece and then decided I shouldn't eat anymore so I wouldn't be hugging my toilet all night. Moving on to the teriyaki chicken.. I open it up and it's cold, and there are huge chunks of dark meat chicken that is cut up with huge slices of peppers on them..okay, I give it a try.. The \"chicken\" has the weirdest texture, has zero flavor and is slimy, I can't do it. I'm super bummed that not only did I spend $30 on what I thought was going to be a delicious meal, but also on the quality of the food. Domo, I'm not into it.

It makes the trip south (practically to Arkansas) worth it!I ended up ordering the udon, Beiber roll, and Mount Fuji. I know, I know.. the Beiber Roll, but with pineapple, mango, tuna and a white cream sauce it was just as fruity as the real Justin. And it was so good. I've never had a roll with the white sauce before and I have no idea what it is, but I'd absolutely get it again. Mount Fuji was also just too epic to pass up. It is a mound of rice covered in sauce and spices and then topped with spicy crab meat which is topped with tuna. Thank heavens I was using chopsticks because they forced me to eat this monster at a reasonable pace.. instead of inhaling it like I wanted to. The udon was great as well (though admittedly nothing too special). I can't wait to return here with my husband.. the menu is large and it took me about 15 minutes of decided between 30 different things before making my choices. The prices are a little higher than other strip-mall places I've been to lately ($9+ a roll), but the quality is all there.

Strangely, the items she points out have the same issues as just discussed.I look across to the manager who is now staring at me. I get it - I'm supposed to accept what they want to serve, vs having a meal that I desire. I'm not obtuse - I get that some restaurants want control - but I've eaten sushi/sashimi for over 35 years - the POINT of a GOOD sushi restaurant is to create food and art that pleases ones senses - not what they want you to take.They don't try to please anyone here.

Our server was attentive, nice and did not bug us while we ate. We sat at the sushi bar, so it was nice to mingle with the chefs a bit.

At lunchtime, they have some very large bento boxes to choose from that have options that include sushi, tempura, Korean food and some not-very-authentic Chinese food.

The BRT specialty roll featured imitation crab and cucumber inside with assorted fish on the top and nice sauce. My main complaint with this role was its size for the price.

The server immediately seemed put off by any questions that myself or the girl with me had to ask about the menu and never got around to bring her the tea she had ordered. I didn't like the crab rangoon, and only ate half of one out of the entire order (6-8 pieces, I believe). The sushi was pretty good though, I must admit. So when the rude waiter came with the check, he asked if I wanted a bag. I declined, with him following up with a question inquiring what I didn't like about it. I mentioned that the crab rangoon was a little too sweet for our tastes, but it wasn't a big deal. He then defensively stated that crab rangoon is the same everywhere, which it isn't. As he went to run my card he blurted out, loudly, \"Well you don't have to come back! It's your choice!\" I said \"No problem, we won't be.\" He then brought the receipt back, with a $0 filled in on the tip portion. The girl I was with and myself are both former servers, I can't believe how bold this guy was! I would think anyone acting like that would know they would probably be fired. When I notified the lady at the bar, she didn't seem concerned whatsoever! Keep in mind, I didn't ask to be refunded for the food, didn't openly complain about the food (until asked) and did not have any \"demands\" after such treatment. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE (unless, perhaps you make a to-go order).Very disappointed. Back to Wasahi for me."]], "Mr. Le's Sushi": [["Brent K.", "the funny thing about the reviews for this place, are most of the people talk about the sushi, it seems nobody cares that they also serve chinese and vietnamese cuisines as well. \u00a0i was just looking to try something new, and finding this place was an adventure, which if you know me, is what i'm all about. \u00a0my iphone did not lead me astray, and i arrived at my destination unscathed, though in the pre-imap days, i probably would have never found it. \u00a0located on Parvin road next to a couple of biker bars, Mr. Le was not present, and neither was any sort of hostess or waitress for that mater. \u00a0the gentleman in charge of the dinning area did eventually tell me to sit where i wanted, and then after what seemed like an eternity brought me menu, and then after a while someone came to get my drink order. \u00a0no explanation about the menu, or what i was supposed to do i with, 1/2 an hour into the experience, i took my order up to the sushi bar, where someone grabbed it from me and told me they would be right with me. \u00a0the food itself came out quickly after that, as did my drink order, but pretty much after that, i was left to fend for myself. \u00a0eventually someone noticed that i was done and asked me if i needed anything else. \u00a0no thanks.the menu is a mixture of sushi, rolls, sashimi, some appetizers, chinese food, and some vietnamese staples. \u00a0i was temped to try the vietnamese, because i'm always on the lookout for it, though I doubt I will ever venture this far away from Midtown again for this kind of service.the sushi it self was not bad, it was presented nicely and tasted fresh enough for a Sunday. \u00a0the place started to fill up after i arrived and I noticed that all of the people coming in were ordering chinese food and not sushi or vietnamese. \u00a0i thought that was odd, but given the location, it's about the only place to eat any kind of food for miles in any direction. \u00a0i personally would never go to a sushi place for chinese food, but who am i to tell anyone what to do. \u00a0it might have been awesome. \u00a0Alas, I will never know.the decor of the place is your typical strip-mall restaurant with vinyl booths and poor lighting. \u00a0the walls have pictures of sushi on them, which was fine i suppose. \u00a0Given all the \"best ever\" yelp reviews, I realized that north of the river, everything is the \"best ever\" because those people really don't get out much. \u00a0Unless they started serving sushi at the casinos that is. \u00a0then watch out \"best ever\" Mr. Le's, watch OUT!"], ["Sara H.", "Love the 913 roll. \u00a0 Shrimp and cucumbers. \u00a0Mr Les the best around. \u00a0 Great price for lunch is the Bento box which includes salad/soup, sushi, chicken teriyaki (or other entree on their menu) and rice. \u00a0A great place for sushi."], ["Jayson R.", "Every time I go there with a few friends the sushi is always great my favorite is the last samurai and the mr.

Kept my glass filled."], ["Kent Jacob S.", "I have heard great things about Mr. Le's Sushi from multiple individuals both friends and coworkers. I haven't been able to venture into the restaurant until last night, 2/19. The location is not necessarily a place where one would expect great sushi, but I know never to judge restaurants by their location or look. It's definitely not a hole-in-the-wall but rather a diamond in the rough (okay, it's not too rough). It's quite a ways up north but still close enough from downtown to visit. The interior is simple with dining tables, booths, and a sushi stand where the Mr. Le creates sushi art. To me, it's feels more like a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. Even the placemat is the paper Chinese zodiac.The d\u00e9cor essentially sums up the menu as it is not purely sushi, nor is it purely Japanese cuisine. You will find a variety of dishes from Vietnam, China, and, of course, Japan. The sushi menu is located on a laminated placard where you will use a dry erase pen to mark your selections. The other menu includes the appetizers and entr\u00e9es. For my first dish at Mr. Le's I tasted the Parvin Roll; it is a fried crispy fish (snapper according to my companion) and cucumber rolled in sushi rice & seaweed that is topped with crab meat doused with spicy mayo. It was quite the delicious roll. I love the cold and chewiness of the crab meat and rice on the outside followed by a warm & crispy bite of the fish. Sadly, this was the only sushi dish we ordered for the night. The other dish was the fried pork chop & egg, a common Vietnamese dish. Needless to say, this dish could not compare to the Parvin roll. The pork chop lacked seasoning and flavor for me and was quite fatty/chewy. I did, however, love the meat loaf and the egg was cooked with the edges burnt, just the way I like it. The rice dish also came with a delicious soup.Service was just fine on a quiet Wednesday night. There was only one server and Mr. Le was the only sushi maker but they managed just fine. I love that they give you a loyalty stamp card which gives you a free sushi roll or appetizers. The Parvin Roll at Mr. Le's has, so far, beat all the other sushi rolls I've tasted in the Kansas City area so I will surely be visiting Mr. Le and his restaurant sometime soon. Trust me, it's worth the drive!"], ["Elizabeth F.", "My fiance and I have been to this restaurant 3 times now. \u00a0We stumbled upon it and it is truly a hidden gem! \u00a0We LOVE their sushi, fried, rice, AND delightfully frozen mugs for beer. \u00a0Seriously, coldest beers around.The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed, definitely not a fancy establishment. \u00a0It is perfect for a low-key lunch or dinner. \u00a0We actually chose Mr. Le's to celebrate my new job - yes, we are becoming regulars.The service is always pleasant and prompt. \u00a0It appears to be a nice family that owns and operates the restaurant.I just read on another review that there is a loyalty rewards card - we haven't seen that yet but I will be asking for it on our next visit! \u00a0Which will probably be this evening, yes, now I am craving Mr. Le's sushi and a psing tao beer."], ["Courtney L.", "I'm normally a big fan of Mr. Le's and have been coming here about once a month for a year. The fish was super fresh, the service was friendly for a small strip mall place and the sushi menu is extensive and creative. They also have a $10 bento box lunch special which includes miso or onion soup, salad, teriyaki meat of your choice, rice and a sushi roll (there is a list of specific rolls you can pick from for the box). It is a lot of food for a great price.However, the last few times I have been here, the service has really slipped. There is one guy who works there as basically a one man show when it comes to taking orders, delivering food and running the register. There is an older woman who helps out as well, but she only rarely makes an appearance. Today for example we arrived and it took almost 10 minutes to take our order because he was helping the line at the register. The food came fairly quickly, but my water was empty for a long while before it was refilled and 4 booths sat empty almost the entire time with the dirty dishes on them. When some people came in, there was no one where to sit and they had to quickly bus one of the tables... Then when it was time for the check we had to wait a bit again.The guy working there (I'm a jerk and should get his name) is really good. He is just super overwhelmed and they definitely need a 2nd employee. I'm not giving up on Mr Le's anytime soon, but if you are in a time crunch for lunch, be aware you might need a smidge more than an hour.Also, don't be offput by the shady strip mall it is in.

Good mix of Vietnamese as well. Spring rolls are excellent as well as the soups. Mr Le and all the servers are attentive and do a great job. The food & service would be worthy of a five star unfortunately the atmosphere is not warm & cozy but plain & more like a cafeteria. Some is due to the location in the older strip mall.

She didn't care that the Midwestern god of weather had decreed a butt-meltingly hot day, she was going to get her putt-putt on.

It was terrifying, and awesome.It must be a crime to operate anything in that Parvin Road strip mall that only serves one function. Mr Le's Sushi is a strip mall setup that serves sushi, pho and assorted Chinese entrees (if the taped-up construction paper menu on one of the walls is to be believed). It is refreshingly shabby, definitely not terrifying, and awesome. Granted, Mr. Le's specializes in fried, cream cheese laden mega-rolls, and those aren't my jam, but the rolls that I've had are solid. Salads are crisp and tasty, soup is about par for a neighborhood sushi joint. But the real appeal of Mr. Le's is somewhere between the ripped vinyl seats, delicious food, friendly service and the TV showing Wheel of Fortune or Glee. It's just a nice place to hang out with friends to nosh and natter and fill up your punch card for free sushi.

Inside, Mr. Le's is bright and cheery.The food at Mr. Le's is what keeps us coming back, though. Despite the dubious location, Mr. Le serves up some of the best sushi we've had. The fish is fresh and the rolls are creative and delicious. Presentation is not brushed over, as rolls are artfully presented and attention is placed on detail. The spicy tuna roll, for example, has a tiny amount of tempura crunch mixed with the tuna and spicy sauce. This adds an unexpected and exciting twist to the typical spicy tuna roll.My favorite Vietnamese dish is Pho, and Mr Le's serves up some of the best Pho Ga around. It's a fancied-up chicken noodle soup, with a complex, aromatic broth, tender slices of chicken, a slew of comforting rice noodles, and a plate of cilantro, basil, sprouts and lime wedges that you add to your taste. So delicious and comforting.Mr. Le's also serves some fantastic spring rolls - soft rice paper filled with shredded lettuce, mint, rice noodles, and thinly-sliced pork, with peanut sauce for dipping.

Known for their sushi, they also offer an asian fusion menu w/ soooo many options!Of course, the sushi is as good as it gets in the midwest, from the nigiri & sashimi to the rolls. I love their Mega Roll filled with tuna, salmon, yellowtail and avocado then tempura fried with yuzu mayo over dynamite sauce. I also enjoy what I would consider the non-traditional, \"Americanized\", rolls like the Mr Dandy which has tempura fried alligator. Or the Forbidden Apple roll that combines apple & mango wi/ tempura shrimp & a peanut sauce. The Mr Lobster roll w/ lobster salad, avocado, cucmber & dynamite sauce is another fave! My ONLY knock on their sushi menu is that they do not have Toro, but I guess I can suffer without it, lol.But, Nara's is much more then just sushi! There are 16 small plates including the grilled scallops in lemon cream sauce & the steamed Vietnamese Bun. They also offer tempura shrimp, chicken, veggies & tofu. Plus grilled Robata skewers like the spicy Thai-Peanut sausage that is made by The Local Pig butcher shop in KC. Also, the Korean kalbi style beef short ribs, which are absolutely craveable w/ the perfect amount of heat. Round the menu out w/ nine entrees (PLUS a special every night) like the Beef Negimaki, thinly sliced sirloin wrapped around green onions served in a large metal bowl w/ their house-made teriyaki, perfectly stir fried vegetables & steamed rice. A mouthwatering must have!They have plenty for those that \"do not eat raw fish\", haha! In fact, you could dine at Nara's 3-4 times a week, doing \"asian tapas\" one night, sushi the next and then come in for an entree & salad while sneaking in a lunch or two. Combine all of that w/ a large saki list & a fully stocked bar & OMG, Nara's is like 4 asian restaurants & a bar all rolled up in one. But even w/ such a large menu, they truly do everything well. And the service is of fine dining quality! Nara's staff is engaging, attentive, knowledgeable and consistant. Check out there specials or their AMAZING Industry night for you restaurant peeps out there!"], ["Jerice A.", "Late night happy hour is decently priced. But the rolls I get don't see to be tight enough and always fall apart. Seafood seems decently fresh (for being in the Midwest) and the head sushi chef is definitely a pro.

I highly recommend this place."], ["Rick M.", "So at the sushi bar and order Omakase, which means \"I'll leave it to you\" or more literally \"to entrust\" and to leave the selection to the chef. Diners who order omakase allow the chef to be creative and they will prepare items not typically found on the standard menu. This is not limited to sushi, and may include items prepared with other methods.You can set a budget and let the chef know what you don't like. The chef will present a series of plates, beginning with the lightest fare and proceeding to richer dishes. I like to just let the chef go at it and then tell him when to stop.Generally you get the best the chef has to offer, and often at a price below what you would pay for \u00e0 la carte."], ["Jiminy C.", "Pretty good place to eat, went on a little lunch date during happy hour (3-6pm).

We eat regularly at Domo, Ra, and Jun's. \u00a0Nara doesn't measure up to any of those, and the prices are outrageous. \u00a0For 2 bowls of Miso soup (the only flavorful thing), three sushi rolls and sake, we spend over $100. The sushi and sashimi were disappointing. It all pretty much tasted the same (bland), except my husband's \"sexy mama,\" which had some sort of smoked salmon or something in it with a disturbing texture. The Sexy Mama at Domo is far better. \u00a0The place is cold and dark and attempts to be chic. If you want a chic bar atmosphere, head to Ra in Leawood - the drink offerings are better and the interior is cleaner and warmer."], ["Endre P.", "Very nice very interesting place. \"Hip\" :-) Staff is very quick both taking and bringing your order and also clearing the table. All staff clearing tables and helping with serving. Food is excellent, great selection, very fresh and well seasoned. Not sure who else is with this like Im but finding a well maintained modern, clean bathroom in a restaurant is a huge plus for me. There can be the best food but if i find an outdated or dirty bathroom, i associate it with the kitchen and feel that the kitchen is in the same shape. \u00a0At Nara, call me crazy, but the bathroom was hip and inviting. (If a bathroom can be inviting?) The plum martini was very nice and recommend if you \u00a0like more of the sweeter type martinis. It is with plum wine and saki. The reason i didnt give 5 star is the noise level. The place is just plane very loud. \u00a0 Plus they have a live singer in the bar area that just adds to the already high decibels. The singer we had that day was excellent as i stood next to him but a few tables away it was just another noise. We had a terrible time hearing each other at the dining table. Will i return? Yes. The food and staff ate both excellent. I just put ear plugs in. :-)"], ["Keanon L.", "Sashimi was great. Generous cuts and more than described on menu. Tasted fresh.Smoked tofu roll was also pretty incredible, though serving every cut of the roll with its own 6\" stick is an odd choice.Sunomono salad was just OK.

I got the Bento Box, which comes with rice, salad, 4 pieces of sushi and a meat (chicken, beef, shrimp) and it wasn't good. The salad was doused with mint dressing, the beef tabata had hardly any meat (tabata is meat on a stick) and the sushi was mini sushi. I know these are supposed to be smaller, lunch portions but if they are going to charge $9 for a bento box, it should be worth $9.

However, if you're like me, and you want actual sushi at a sushi restaurant's HH, Nara is not the spot for you. While the HH drink menu is expansive, there are only four roll options (and they aren't that impressive).

Check them out instead."], ["Michelle B.", "I'm definitely a fan of Nara, it has a great atmosphere and the food is delicious! \u00a0They have a fantastic selection of sushi and other options for those who may not like sushi. \u00a0My date and I got spicy tuna rolls, philadelphia rolls and the vegas rolls all of which were absolutely delicious and that's saying a lot coming from me because I'm extremely picky about the sushi I eat. \u00a0We had a great drinks to go along with our dinner and a fantastic desert after dinner.The service was good and our waitress was attentive without constantly being at our table. \u00a0I would definitely go back as well as recommend it to my friends. \u00a0It's definitely a great spot for a date as well as going out with a group of friends."], ["Elyse D.", "One of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City!

Recommend this place for sure."], ["Charley B.", "Nara is still good, but it sure isn't like it used to be.I brought a friend here a couple of weeks ago and we were seated in the dining room. We quickly learned that we needed to tell the hostess that we were there for the Friday Night Happy Hour and be seated at the bar instead of just coming in and asking the waitress about it. We didn't and our waitress just about had a meltdown. She abruptly left and after about five minutes a hostess came over and resat us in the back area. Then about fifteen minutes later our same waitress reappeared, still upset and disheveled, but a little calmed down. I hope we didn't ruin her night.Moving on, the sushi was good. I enjoyed the Local Pig dish and the spicy tuna. My friend noted that the crab rangu was some of the best she's had.I also now know that if I come back again, I need to ask about the late night happy hour."], ["Meghan M.", "During my many years in KC, I've avoided Nara due to its hip, cool kid, dress up and show off vibe. That's just not quite my style. It always seemed like it was trying too hard to be cool. Anyways, I was finally wooed in by their ample promotional menus, and now, I've frequented it twice in one week. #sushiaddictionFirst, they have a pretty good happy hour menu that's offered 3-6 Monday through Saturday. They also have reverse HHs. Their HH menu offers specials on sushi, drinks, appetizers, and cooked items. They also have a great ladies night promo on Wednesday nights which offers more than the typical HH menu (including $5 Vegas rolls...mmm). The most important and delicious item to get is their Nara Cane Martini. It is addictive deliciousness. Five stars for the martini, and four for the rest of the menu. \u00a0The space is cool. The fellow patrons varied greatly. The first night there it seemed to be douchey date night. It was a bit much, but at least the overheard conversations were entertaining. The next time we came there (Friday HH), it was a much older and varied crowd. We saw everything from families to young couples to work groups to older folks. It was a different sight than the other night.The biggest hang up of this place is their service. The host and manager are more attentive than the waitresses, and they try to fill in service gaps when possible. Our first night we had the rudest waitress. She rolled her eyes at us when we asked a question and refused to make eye contact with us when talking about the specials. It was odd. She did defrost a bit as the night went on, but she was one of the iciest waitresses I've ever had (besides the service at Wiener's Circle where you go to be verbally abused). Our next visit, we had a kinder, less bouffant-ed waitress. She was good, but we had some execution problems, such as waiting at least 30 minutes for crab rangoon and overcharging us on beer. In short, it's a decent place. I will likely keep it in mind for happy hours, but I don't know if I would consider it beyond that. Their service definitely needs some refining."], ["Bailey R.", "The sushi chef was fantastic! I sat at the bar and he told me great places to visit, entertained my questions about the rolls he was making and just chatted with me while working furiously. The rest of the staff was also super friendly. The make your own bento bowl was an incredible deal for the amount and quality of the food. The atmosphere was really neat as well. Overall an amazing experience!"], ["Matt E.", "It seems to me that Nara has never lived up to its potential. It has a gorgeous interior, with a nice bar and lounge area, and it's in a great part of town. There's a great patio that has one of the best views of downtown in the city. But unfortunately, it seems to have completely fallen off KC's nightlife radar. And even more unfortunate is that as a restaurant it's not exactly blowing me away, either.Let's first talk about that restaurant aspect. While I really enjoy their non-sushi offerings, I think their sushi menu is just pretty bland and poorly executed. For a sushi restaurant, that's not a good thing. I can't really think of any rolls that I would highly recommend. BUT, I really enjoy most of the stuff off their robata menu, their crab rangoon are some of the best in town, and the pad thai is excellent (and SPICY!) Still, it's a shame when a sushi bar's sushi is the least impressive aspect of the menu.Let it be known that I think the service at Nara has always been spot on. I have heard complaints from others, but I have never witnessed that myself. I think their dude bartender that (at least used to) work on Tuesday evenings is fantastic, and my servers in the dining room have always been helpful and friendly. I dig the staff here. As I said before, I think the bar area is great. It's comfortable, looks fantastic, and has so much potential. They just need to realize it. I'd start by revamping the cocktail menu, which I don't think has changed in years and can't keep up with the rising sophistication level of KC cocktail culture. Plus, they just need to figure out a way to get some more bodies in the room. They used to have DJs, and people would dance and it'd be great. Now, weekends are a ghost town. They also used to show hilarious old Japanese movies on the screens. I think that's gone by the wayside as well. I like Nara, so I hate that it sounds like I'm bagging on them a ton. But they need to step up."], ["Alex W.", "My wife had her 20 year high school reunion here, \u00a0upstairs.

Get the Russian Standard. Seriously, go get it so that hopefully I can eventually find Russian Standard at a liquor store somewhere. Chop chop, let's go!I honestly thought I would hate Nara when I first went there based on past experiences with similar places that desperately want to be trendy. I was pleasantly surprised, though!The secret about Nara based on what I'm reading is to go on weekdays. I have frankly been to Nara dozens of times, but never on a Friday or Saturday and I think it's made all the difference. There's that annoying trend where asian fusion places have some crappy House DJ blaring cheesy \"soulful house\" and the interior looks upscale and everything, but then the food is just awful and the servers are elitist pricks. I can see how that sort of works in, say, New York, but in the Midwest it's always sort of weird. Thankfully, Nara has the interior but generally not the attitude or the awful DJ, or at least as far as I have seen on weekdays. Ok, there is something not on the menu which is what you should be ordering. Omikase. Basically, it's chef's choice. If you're not cheap about it ($80 for 2 people is a reasonable minimum) it is consistently amazing and you will always get different things you've likely never had before by ordering it. If you sit at the sushi bar and order this, often the chef gives you all kinds of weird and wonderful appetizers as he's preparing your main course(s). I have never been disappointed.The only slightly bad thing is that I came in once on like a Wednesday night or something and they were having this one-man band doing cover songs poorly kinda deal. Fortunately, the outdoor patio was open so I was able to get away from it - had it been closed I would have left. I guess lots of other people felt the same way since the patio was full that evening while the main dining room was nearly empty."], ["Phillip L.", "I'm really surprised the reviews aren't better for Nara. We got there during happy hour and had some of their hummus and crab rangoon. The rangoon was probably the best I've had. Next up was dinner and we ordered the crispy cheesy Cali roll, forbidden apple roll, mr dandy roll, jalape\u00f1o popper roll, and the dreams of summer roll. All 5 delivered. They have a fantastic variety of rolls to choose from and you won't be let down by the quality. For dessert we tried the mochi, and I'm not sure what it is, but it was delicious!

All the different meat cuts are tasty, especially the lamb. The veggies are fresh and the udon noodles are a nice touch to add to your hot pot. I also really like the sauce they give you with a bit of onion and fresh garlic. It's a really nice little presentation that you mix together yourself. Consider paying $25 for all you can eat but beware there is an up charge for each flavored broth you get of 3-4 dollars. So if you choose two flavors it can bump your bill up to $33. I recommend the spicy broth and then just getting regular on the other side."], ["Robin S.", "We love the Japanese fondue experience!

Each table with a hot plate had four chairs so you might be next to others. \u00a0We were provided menus and had it explained to us. \u00a0Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and was friendly. \u00a0We ordered the Meat combo which came with two choices of beef, chicken, pork or lamb (we chose beef and lamb) ($29.95), the Seafood Platter which came with shrimp, salmon, fish balls, scallops, squid, and shrimp balls ($29.95), the Dragon Roll ($11.95) and the Spicy Tuna Roll ($8.95). \u00a0Each one came with a vegetable plate and a choice of udon noodles, vermicelli noodles, or rice. \u00a0We got the udon noodles and rice. \u00a0The two broths we chose were the Chicken broth (complementary) and the Chinese Spicy broth (Mongolian style) ($4.50). \u00a0We were debating whether to order more but we would decide later. The food took a while to come out while they were setting up our hot pot. \u00a0The amount of meat we received seemed like it was less than what I had seen at other shabu shabu places I've been to in the past (not to mention two slices of meat fell off while our waiter brought it to us). \u00a0The chicken broth didn't add any flavor to the meat so I had to dip it with the sauce we were given to mix together (I forgot the names but I took a picture of them). \u00a0The Chinese Spicy broth was a little spicy but might be very spicy to others. \u00a0It added more flavor to the meat and I liked that one better. \u00a0The Spicy Tuna Roll was okay, but I definitely had better in the past. \u00a0There was a lot of tuna in each roll though so that was good. \u00a0The Dragon Roll was okay as well and again, I've had a better roll in the past. \u00a0We decided to add more beef (I was still hungry) which ended up being $12 extra and would vary in price depending on what you originally ordered. \u00a0It didn't say anywhere on the menu that it was an additional fee so it would have been nice to know how much each meat would additionally cost. \u00a0It took a little while before we got the extra beef.

The large hot pot is heated on your table and divided into two sections for the broths.While the broth was heating, our spring roll arrived. It is served with a tasty peanut sauce. \u00a0The spring roll had a good initial flavor, but upon the second bite, the noodles overtook the flavor. \u00a0Adding an internal sauce would bring these up to, \"a must have\". \u00a0We also had the daikon roll, very good, tuna, wrapped in a radish, with a tart Ponzu-like sauce.The broths are boiling, so it's cook time. \u00a0We were instructed to cook the veggies first, as the meat only takes a couple minutes, it is sliced very thin. \u00a0The food also comes with some added ingredients, the waiter gave a simple explanation, but the owner, a very nice Vietnamese lady gave us the real run down. \u00a0They provide a house made soy sauce, very good, a concentrated Chinese BBQ, garlic, cilantro, and a spicy relish. \u00a0She explained that once the cooked items were removed from the broth, they suggest you make a dipping sauce from the above mentioned ingredients to finalize the flavor to your liking. \u00a0I created my sauce and the combination was perfect for myself, but a tad \"hot\", for my wife. \u00a0She made a milder version. \u00a0They broth cooking allowed you to create meat veggie combinations to your liking, My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal.All the food was very tasty, but I found myself wondering what I would do if I was eating alone, or in a hurry, as the hot pot menu portions are designed to share. \u00a0After we finished and were paying the bill, the owner approached and asked how everything went. \u00a0She saw me taking pictures and I saw her watching me on a couple occasions. \u00a0We discussed the time issues for lunch, and she is in the process of tweaking the lunch menu, and through our brief discussion, it sounds like she's on top of things and has some good options in the works, like some ready to eat options. \u00a0She's still looking for those star servers to help present the experience with the same passion she has. \u00a0Our server was ok, but left a lot of the finer details of the meal out.The Q hot pot, is a diamond in the making. I'm confident she sees the challenges of a new restaurant, and most places with good, healthy, and fun food, with an involved owner, find ways to remain a destination eating experience. \u00a0I will give her a few more weeks to tweak things and I'll definitely be coming back."], ["Ronnie L.", "Wow. \u00a0That was delicious. \u00a0I've always wanted to try hot pot and thought we'd have to go to a large city like New York or Chicago to finally try it out. \u00a0The experience was fantastic.

Walking in, we were greeted, seated, and given menus promptly. The menus are very easy to read with a simple layout of drinks, sushi, tapas plates, and of course--HOT POTS! You are crazy if you don't get a hot pot. To start, I opted for the Beijing Bellini which is a drink consisting of champagne, lychee liquor, and a lychee fruit dropped in the bottom of the glass--very thirst quenching! For tapas we went with crab rangoon and seaweed salad. The salad was just OK but the crab rangoon was a superstar on its own. They're on the bigger side and freshly made with no shortage of cream cheese delicousness on the inside. Served with a sweet chili sauce, it was the perfect partner. *cue mouth-watering* \u00a0We skipped the sushi rolls since the hot pot was our mission. We decided on the seafood platter (shrimp, salmon, fish and shrimp balls, scallops, squid--also mussels and clam which weren't listed) with the vegetarian and Korean Kim chi broths. It came with a variety of vegetables like lettuce, carrots, corn on the cob, mushrooms, bok choy, and a choice between udon and vermicelli noodles. (We went vermicelli.) You will put your veggies in when it starts to boil, then let it come to a boil again, and cook your proteins. The seafood is a little more work because the proteins take different times to cook (for example: fish balls are on the longer side at about 5 minutes). You'll also make a dipping sauce. I don't remember all the ingredients used but I do know there's green onions, garlic, and some sort of spicy paste you can add.

They were these tiny egg rolls stuffed with pork and veggies fried just right and served with a chili dippin' sauce...the chili dippin' sauce is very important here. DON'T let them take the plate away because I took one of wifeys scallops and dipped itn into the chili sauce and it was awesome. ALSO get the fried rice. A huge plate with tender fried rice with lots of vegetables in it and of course the egg scrambled into it. NEXT TIME IDEA...gotta try the \"Udon\" section of the menu or the hot pot part.

It came with a veggie platter which is where the disappointment comes from. It was a random selection of veggies not often put in hot pot that almost appeared to be scraps put together. For example there was thin pieces of cabbage but not the green portion of it, and random carrot pieces. The broth was absolutely flavorless and the staff were all eating dinner as well while being truly unprofessional.

Not sure if they changed anything but I felt the broth was better the second time. The service was excellent both times. It's like the hot pot you can get in Dallas but with a trendy hip ambiance. Yay for KC!!"], ["Hsinyeh H.", "Had hot pot for lunch, all you can eat style. Good portion for everything requested. Love it and will definitely come back again!"]]}
