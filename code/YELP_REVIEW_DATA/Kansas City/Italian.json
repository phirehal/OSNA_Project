You won't find Spaghetti-O's or Sysco bagged penne here. Oh no, Cupini's staff takes the time and effort to hand craft each variety of pasta they serve from scratch. Whether you're getting tortellini (and you ARE getting tortellini), lasagna, rav, or simple linguine, the freshest expertly pressed noodles will be making an your plate.I decided on the Chicken/Prosciutto Tortellini and a slice of margherita, but was fortunate enough to snag a sampling of the lasagna as well. The pizza, mid-crusted with a slight crunch and a nice bit of chew, was spot on. Thin, non-viscous, semi-sweet and herby tomato sauce, plenty of melty mozz, and nicely interspersed leaves of fresh basil sum up the well balanced slice of pie; in all honesty, if the rest of the options here weren't so good they could stand on the pizza alone.The quarter wedge of lasagna, with its alternating layers of tender pasta, ricotta, marinara and ground beef sauce, and mozzarella, was one of the best interpretations of the dish I've had. But, as great as the lasagna was, I stand behind my decision to order the tortellini 100%. The woven, twisting shape highlights the pasta in a way the lasagna sheet doesn't impart. A yielding, pillowy soft surface and resistant bite at the instant you cut through makes the freshness of the noodle evident. The perfect proportion of salty, almost bacon-like ham and tender chicken filling compliments its companion without overwhelming, and the cream of the tomato based sauce balances acidity and adds a nice silky finish to the dish.If you've never had freshly prepared pasta, Cupini's will open up your eyes to a new, Maruchan ramen, Chef Boyardee devoid world or magnificence that will forever put to shame your mom's spaghetti night. But is that such a bad thing?"], ["Natalie H.", "Pretty good casual place overall. \u00a0Quick and casual.What I would come back for over and over again is the tomato basil white pizza. \u00a0YUM! \u00a0The reason for my 4 star review!I also ordered the linguine with bolognese sauce and meatballs. \u00a0It was just OK.

Will not disappoint!"], ["Jason Y.", "I absolutely deplore the Olive Gardens, Johnny Carino's, Fazoli's, and Carrabba's of the so-called Italian restaurants. Therefore, it will take a whole lot of negative things to happen at Cupini's for me not to give them positive reviews. Sure, there are some minor nit-picky issues to be said about Cupini's. Then again, outside of New York, Philadelphia, or New Jersey, how many 5 star true Italian neighborhood type eateries really exist?Cupini's attempts to mimic that east coast type Bodega in one sense. But as you walk through the dark little corridor off to the side of the main food prep/ordering area you come upon a small dinning area that resembles someones living room in the Westport neighborhood that Cupini's is located. Dark and cozy interior with a lot of character. The food is the real star of Cupinis as one would expect. The pasta is absolutely fresh and delicious! When I say \"fresh\", I'm talking it's hand rolled from the dough all the way to the blanching/boiling of the pasta. Veggies are cut fresh. Sauce is homemade. Don't misunderstand what I'm saying, I have seen some canned/Sysco type ingredients in Cupini's. But for the most part everything is as fresh as you will find in Kansas City. Don't sleep on their sandwiches either. They are so much better than anything you will find at the chain sandwich shops. The one question I'm still trying to get answers to is whether the bread is made in house or brought in? The meatball sandwiches rival those in some of the larger metropolitan cities on the east coast. Their cold sandwiches are really good but nothing ground breaking.Back to the pasta.........I'm telling you right now this stuff just has a unique flavor and texture that is unbelievable. This includes their lasagna, cannelloni's, tortellini, manicotti (oh gawd!), and their seafood ravioli. The sauces are rich and not too salty. Not too spicy. Not too sweet. Right on point and consistent. Never tried the pizza. Will definitely be trying the calzone in the near future. I'm not a vegetarian but forgot to mention the veggie menu at Cupini's is very good as well. Some days you just don't feel like being a carnivore and Cupini's can take care of that.The real surprise for many people walking into Cupinis is the shear volume of baked goods available. Supposedly, all the baked goods are made in house. Hard for me to tell, but I do know what I've had are delicious. \u00a0 \u00a0OK, here are some minor issues. Prices aren't the cheapest in town for the amount of food you get. This is a situation of quality over quantity. Which is cool, as long as the food stays consistency good and fresh. Parking can be spotty on weekends. Heck, weekday parking along Westport road can be tricky sometimes. Me personally, I love the neighborhood. Others have issues with Westport. It's not a bad area and families are indeed welcome in the neighborhood. You don't have to be a 20-30 yr old party animal to enjoy Westport.Forgot to mention the servers at Cupini's are quite good at what they do. Solid 4 stars for the service at Cupini's. If you've never been to Cupini's, do yourself a favor and get away from the suburban Italian chain restaurants and give them a look. I'd be shocked if you're disappointed.

Whether ordering ala carte from the menu or enjoying their fabulous Sunday brunch, the food is always consistent and delicious although a bit pricey.Antipasti (appetizers) range from $7.50 to $14.00 and include traditional favorites like \"frico\" (cheese crisp - $12.50), \"cozze\" (mussels - $12.00), \"arancini\" (deep fried risotto balls - $12.00), and \"pappa al pomodoro\" ( a Tuscan tomato and bread soup - $7.50). The frico, for example, is delicious with crispy cheese (usually a higher-fat hard cheeses like Montasio or Asiago) baked in the oven with various decadent ingredients, having originated in the Friuli region of Italy.\"Insalate\" (salads) are normally ordered along with the main course (secondo) when dining in Italy and are not \"meal size\" as you will find in the United States. At Lidia's they range from $8.00 to $12.50, but I cannot comment on them as I have never ordered one because, other than the Caprese salad - one of my favorites, you should not come to a restaurant like Lidia's unless you plan on focusing on pasta and meat/seafood dishes, which are quite filling.Ranging from $17.00 (canneloni) to $22.00 (pasta trio), the prices for their \"primi\" (first courses - pastas) are Lidia's \"Best Value\", especially their \"pasta trio\" which my wife and I have had on numerous occasions. This \"all you can eat\" medley of three pastas changes daily and includes three different pastas (fettucine, penne, ravioli, etc.), each with its own sauce (butter and sage, amatriciana, and other favorites). Servers come around with a large plate of each, giving you as much or as little as you desire so you can sample all three before deciding on which one (or three) you want more of. You can add a caesar salad and choice of dessert for an additional $13, but I would not waste my money and recommend enjoying as much pasta as you can eat instead. The meat and seafood (secondi) dishes are not cheap at $21 for the lemon chicken to $49.50 for the bone-in rib eye steak, but if you like a traditional Italian meal with antipasto, primo and secondo, you will not be disappointed ... but you will be bursting at the seams! Secondi at Lidia's, unlike restaurants in Italy, are accompanied by \"contorni\" (vegetables and potatoes), making a full meal if you prefer meat and potatoes over pasta. My favorite used to be their \"involtini di manzo\", rolled beef scallops with pickle, vegetables and mustard (a Northern Italian recipe), accompanied by mashed potatoes, but it has not been on the menu lately.Their wine list is extensive with nothing under $32 for a bottle (the \"Value List\" has a nice selection of reds and whites) and ranging up to as high as $495 for a bottle of Lange (2005) Gaja if that is your style. We have ordered from the value list every time we have been there and found the wines quite good and somewhat as the name implies, a \"decent\" value. They also have a full bar with drinks ranging from $9 to $34.We have not been there for Sunday brunch in several years, but it used to be an excellent value at $25 (now $29.50). Served buffet style, you can help yourself to a nice selection of antipasti and dolci (desserts), ordering a selection from a wide variety on main courses, including the \"Pasta Tasting Menu\", frico, porchetta hash, osso buco, and lasagna Bolognese among others.We have never been there for lunch, but looking at the menu it appears to be a decent value with meal selections reduced by $5 or so compared to the dinner menu and with sandwiches in the $12 to $13 range. Expect to pay a $100 to $125 for dinner for two, including antipasti and either a primo (pasta) or secondo, a bottle of wine from the value list, and a shared dessert (tip and tax included). We cannot afford to spend that kind of money every time we go out to eat, but for special occasions Lidia's Italy - Kansas City is a decent value with exceptional food, excellent service, and moderate prices.CombatCritic Gives Lidia's Italy - Kansas City 7 out of 10 Bombs ...

Both were in a stew, melting in my mouth. The texture was perfect. The flavor was divine! I could taste the tomatoes and imagined them simmering for hours to make this delightful dish. I could just picture Lidia herself in the kitchen, cooking and tasting to perfection. Oh, how wonderful this entree was!My friend ordered the pasta trio tasting, and this was mediocre to me. Although I liked the fusilli (had a kick to it), I was not impressed by the ravioli (like undercooked Chinese dumplings) or fettucini. Both lacked robust flavors, and I was glad I ordered the duck.I didn't think the entrees were that expensive for being Lidia's kitchen. My braised duck was $18 (does not come with a salad).

Overall it was a nice dinner out with friends, quiet enough to have a conversation. \u00a0There was a largw party close by so that is an option. \u00a0You can also choose to sit inside or out in the patio.The pasta trio runs about $22 for an endless table side serving of pasta (if I wasn't with other people I might have refilled since I did enjoy the raviolli, but I couldn't so I can't say much about the refills). \u00a0The dessert menu looked delicious and I believe they were in the $12 range.Calamari was $12 and the special was about $22Food comes with fresh bread and 2 spreads today one was a bean spread and the other a pesto something"], ["Shawn B.", "First off the service was just OK. \u00a0We had to ask about certain things even though we told them we had never been here before. \u00a0We had no idea you could order from the main menu during brunch until we heard another server tell someone after we had ordered. \u00a0They did write \"Happy Birthday\" on my son's dessert plate and placed a candle in it.The butter (Apricot Jam Butter, Strawberry Jam Butter, and Crunchy Sugar Butter) \u00a0they give you with the brunch bread basket is ridiculously over sugared on all 3 choices. \u00a0It was seriously like eating a spoonful of sugar with your bread, complete with the crunching of sugar crystals. \u00a0They should offer a more traditional, non-sugared, option. \u00a0The Antipasti Table was pretty good, not sure it was worth the extra $13 over the Restaurant Week lunch price.We had the pasta trio option. \u00a0I wish they listed the different types on their menu so I could name them. \u00a0All I can say is the one with broccoli and fettuccine had way too much broccoli taste to it. \u00a0It was overpowering...and I like broccoli. \u00a0One was some type of cheese and pear ravioli which is quite good, albeit somewhat sweet. \u00a0Just a few of these go a long way. \u00a0The third was a tomato based sauce with a rigatoni pasta, this was the best one overall. \u00a0All of the pastas were fresh pasta that had a nice chew to it.Some things seemed bland, some things were not well balanced, but we were stuffed when we left the place. \u00a0I would go again...someday."], ["Deana W.", "This update is for the Happy Hour menu.Monday- Friday 4 -6 pm Bar and Patio$3 beers$4 mixed drinks$5 Grapefruit Cosmopolitan $5 Lemone, Lemone, Lemone$5 wine$5 small plates such as Arancine lobster risotto balls in a tomato basil butter, or Bruschetta with ricotta, broccoli rabe, and butternut squash.Enticing food and libations served in an elegant setting, at a fraction of the cost."], ["Marc D.", "We stopped in for a Saturday brunch here.$100 meal for two people. \u00a0 I did not get the quality for the money spent. \u00a0Service was iffy. \u00a0started out explaning and welcoming great and then dropped off. \u00a0 Drinks left unfilled. water empty. \u00a0I flagged a bus boy down for a refill of my wifes drink and (no offense against him) did not understand english enough to understand we were asking for a refill of her drink.He did bring back a glass of tea for her, but she was drinking a diet soda.

What is the biggest downfall of this place was the service. When they brought out the pasta which was served from the pan, that I thought was a really nice feature. Two of the three servers splattered sauce on my napkin that had been tucked into my shirt, Thank God! No apologies, no nothing just slapped the pasta on my plate and took off. Our bill was $150 and to be honest if I'm spending that kind of money with no alcohol I expect amazing food and even better service.

After 15 minutes and still no drinks served, we started to wonder if this was the place for us so we talked to a group of locals at the bar and they assured us Lidia's was amazing and it was best to stay. The host sat us in the patio room saying the kids would like to see the train pass by. The room was loud and bright. There were lots of large groups seated. The host was very polite and kind and we thanked him for getting us seated quickly considering we didn't have a reservation. We were given bread and two dips on a plate of olive oil. 10 minutes later, we were excited to see our waitress. We were ready to order a bottle of wine and the mussels to get started. But she robotically rattled off the specials with disattachment and wouldn't even make eye contact with us. \u00a0I tried to ask a question, and she walked away. I stared at my husband in disbelief. I said, \"Was she really that rude to us?\" She continued to ignore us for another 10 minutes. The table of two next to us was equally uncomfortable. So we got up and left. We were grateful the host gave us a recommendation on where to have decent BBQ without the fuss. We would've stayed but the waitress was just too rude. She couldn't have made us feel any more unwelcome.

We had three entrees to choose from (the pasta trio, Porcini rubbed tenderloin of beef or a fish entree). My husband decided on the tenderloin, which turned out to be impeccably seasoned, juicy and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. I went with the pasta trio which was served table-side, right from the skillet, all-you-can eat style. There was a pumpkin and goat cheese ravioli, a bolognese , and a linguini...I just can't even describe how tasty the homemade pasta was. Utterly decadent. The staff was loud, proud and motivated.

It was thinner than any other alfredo sauce I've ever seen and it tasted slightly of chicken stock. Chicken stock...that was weird...anyway...I got the OBG sauce on angel hair and it was just like the good ol' days. What was truly wonderful was the PRICE.

I love cabs but this one was bad.. just bad... I traded yummy wine for a Sam Adams. Because they're food was SO good and the atmosphere was beautiful \u00a0I giive it a solid 4 stars. However it is a little pricier. Expect to pay for the setting"], ["Cindy R.", "The Happy Hour here isn't too darn bad. \u00a0I know you're not supposed to compare places but it's very similar to Brio (if you haven't been here and you've been there).The sangria is good, mojitos are cold and Happy Hour food is yum!I recommend the crispy shrimp and caprese salad. \u00a0Everything else I saw looked quite good also though!The bar staff seems to get a little overwhelmed during Happy Hour... they only had 2 bartenders... might be a smart thing to tag someone else on during that time. \u00a0Besides that, it was a good Happy Hour!"], ["AJ F.", "We love their Sicilian Pizza! The sausage is always flavorful and cut into good sized pieces. The crust is cooked perfectly and is thin but not too crispy. We enjoyed the chopped salad to go along with the complimentary breadsticks. The atmosphere is great, even though this restaurant is in the middle of a busy outdoor mall you won't be disappointed by the ambiance. The wait staff is attentive & friendly. We love Bravo's and eat here each time we come to Zona Rosa."], ["Sarah K.", "Great option for Italian food in the area. \u00a0The servers are polite and attentive. \u00a0The food is a little expensive but the flavor and quality are on par with the price. \u00a0Each meal is served with a herbed bread and oil dipping sauce. \u00a0Their lobster bisque is very rich and tasty. \u00a0I really like their lasagna, but have had other dishes and found them to be very good as well. \u00a0The sauces are rich and flavorful and the pasta has a freshly prepared taste. \u00a0I came on one occasion with family from out of town and the hostesses were nice enough to provide them with some information about the Zona Rosa area. \u00a0The atmosphere is family friendly but not loud. \u00a0It is a good location for a date, family dinner, or a meeting. \u00a0There is both indoor and outdoor seating available. \u00a0Overall, an enjoyable and quality experience."], ["Sean L.", "Foods fucking great here I love carbohydrates. They don't automatically bring you water anymore; I blame California. Also, I've been in Kansas City way too much this past month."], ["Faith B.", "Decent Italian chain with food that will get you through your shopping marathons.We stopped here in the midst of holiday shopping and were able to immediately get a seat at the bar.Drinks were served quickly - which was quite important mid-shopping trip.We ordered a flat bread with mushroom and caramelized onion that was tasty and filling. We ordered the large, but were brought the small. The bartender immediately corrected the bill and offered to get us the large, but the small was fine for splitting.The artichoke dip was also creamy, cheesy and tasty. It was served with cracker-style bread and I may have enjoyed thicker toast with it, but that's a minor flaw.The bill, however, was the equivalent of full dinners many places.Still, this is a good option at Zona."]], "Trezo Mare Restaurant and Lounge": [], "Rozzelle Court Restaurant": [], "Garozzo's Ristorante": [["Amy G.", "I love Garozzo's! I try to go here about once a month. It is such a wonderful atmosphere and even though there are tight quarters you don't feel packed in somehow. The waiters and bartenders are always friendly, fast and knowledgeable about the wines, etc. It's a little pricey but you get SO MUCH delicious food to take home with you."], ["Rachel J.", "This is a staple in our family! What used to be a restaurant only for special events has now transitioned into a semi-regular eatery for us. For the most part, dinner service is always prompt, polite and delish. Tonight our server was very energetic, courteous and very pleasant. The restaurant ambiance brings you back in time and provides a fun snapshot of Kansas City. Most certainly a place to visit in KC if you are craving Italian!"], ["Ramon L.", "We made reservations here for a large party and the staff and chef were phenomenal! The food is very good, the location amazing and ambiance perfect for this Italian family-style ristorante. Yes, it is a tourist destination, but that fact does not detract from what is fundamentally a very good restaurant. Come solo, with a date or a large group....you will not be disappointed!"], ["Amanda V.", "Absolutely delicious! My family and I ordered 3 different spiedinis and the veal mushroom ravioli. Everything was great but the veal ravioli was insanely amazing. I can't wait to come back!"], ["Rose P.", "Surprisingly this was a good place for lunch. The prices are reasonable. The ingredients were fresh especially the seafood. The service was ok, nothing too spectacular. Great food."], ["Peter T.", "The fresh baked bread was greay, the garlic dip was good, except the oil flavor stays in your mouth for up to two days.... Spaghetti was ok, of you like a tomato soup sweet flavor, I am more of a Tuscany tart dried tomato sauce. ..It reminded me of Chef Boyardee can stuff.I had a steak, it's was good, then again how can one screw up a steak, so that's a given...yet I must admit the sauce on the steak was to die for...Service was good, location in K C is fun in Little Italy.If one tried other things perhaps I'd enjoy it more,I could be wrong because it was a very fun bunch of customers there and many \u00a0were regulars."], ["Ben S.", "Standard Italian American restaurant that gives you the feeling of a quiet, dark familial setting with food that goes above the standard. It's not fancy, its not pretentious and it doesn't play to the crazy, overly-bombastic Italian stereotype restaurants that most people associate with this kind of food. Always fun to go here, especially for the price."], ["A J.", "Meh. I'd probably give Garozzo's 3 stars if it weren't so overpriced. All of the food is good, but you can find better. It's very old school Italian and everything is swimming in sauce. The sauce is delicious and often the best part of each dish, but I've ordered the gnocchi here and found it to be cut very inconsistently and therefore cooked very inconsistently. The cheese used in many of the dishes isn't of the quality that I'd expect for such an expensive dish, especially the Parmesan."], ["Lea L.", "I always try to eat here before going to the ballet. Why? Because the amazing ambiance and deliciousness they call food makes for an unforgettable night. Dishes to try...EVERYTHING! But my fave is the Fruitti de Mare...I would swim in beshamel sauce if someone let me!"], ["Wenday L.", "It's a long story but I came here mainly wanting to try their tartufo affogato. It just happens to be my birthday and the family came to town to celebrate it with me, so I thought this would be as good a time as ever to try this place out. First of all, I didn't know that there is a birthday special here! Apparently, you get a free spiedini di pollo if you come here on your birthday! Just be sure to bring some kind of photo ID with your birthdate on it.Don't be fooled by the exterior, as I was, because although it's tucked away in some seemingly forgotten part of town, the d\u00e9cor is very cozy and the service was excellent! It's a little dim inside, but the candle light on the table makes for an intimate and cozy setting.We had stuffed artichoke for the appetizer, but I'm personally not a huge fan. It is certainly good, with the perfect garlic butter base to the cheesy stuffing. I'd recommend spreading the stuffing on their bread. We had the Italian wedding soup, and that was fantastic as well. The meatballs were the most perfect meatballs I have ever had. The soup was flavorful and simply yummy, although it left me quite dehydrated after a couple spoons, but that's just me and my primarily bland diet.For entrees, we ordered Gabriella, Georgio, and the seafood dish with angel hair pasta in diablo spicy sauce (sorry I forgot what the name was). The seafood dish wasn't anything spectacular in my opinion. The scallops were small and too chewy, but I didn't expect much as far as seafood goes here. The Gabriella was much more sour than the Georgio, not what I was expecting. However, the Gabriella did have a little kick to it. I absolutely LOVED the Georgio dish, because it had the perfect seasoning for me. I especially love the fact that they used whole saut\u00e9ed basil leaves, because they added a special flavor to the dish. Now the spiedini di pollo is just to-die-for. The seasoning was perfect, and I don't even know how they managed to make chicken breast that tender and moist. Be forewarned, their dishes are humongous. One serving can probably keep you full for 2 or 3 meals. The nice thing is that the reheated leftover Georgio is just as good as when it was freshly served.Last but not least, the dessert: tartufo affogato al caffe. This is like a dessert Russian doll because tartufo is a legitimate dessert on its own, but in this case is used as a component in an affogato dessert. You should look up these desserts if you're interested, but the version served here is a ball of half vanilla and half chocolate ice-cream with a surprise cherry in the center. The ice-cream ball is coated by a thin chocolate shell. When it's served, the server will pour a shot of warm espresso on top of the chocolate-covered ice-cream ball. This was my first time trying an affogato, but it was an extremely satisfying experience for me. There are several other places around town that also serve affogato, but in the simpler ways, and I'll definitely be checking them all out!"], ["Sara-Elizabeth D.", "It was a little pretentious and pricey. Service was quick, but definitely not friendly. I think that's what turned me off most. As soon as we didn't order a glass of pricey wine our waiter got smug. I ordered the manicotti which was okay. My sister ordered the gnocchi and it was better. I don't think I will return mainly because I was dying to get out of there."], ["Food F.", "Fantastic restaurant. \u00a0Great service. \u00a0Fantastic calamari to start the meal, interesting garlic dip. I had the chicken spideini Georgio and spouse had shrimp spiedini Maggie. Both outstanding. \u00a0The shrimp was some of the best I've had. Kids meals are large, good selection and the wines are great and reasonably priced either by the glass, Demi or full bottle. Cheers to Sherri from MN for the great service."], ["Sarah T.", "First time coming to this restaurant was for my mother's wedding dinner. \u00a0We reserved the room upstairs, the decor was lovely and it was very cozy. \u00a0Our waiter was very professional and attentive, he was joined farther into the meal by a couple other helpers, but he was clearly running the show. \u00a0We had a four course meal; seafood ravioli (amazing), insalata (great, not much of a salad person but still good), Frankie's chicken (my choice for entree, very delicious and a huge portion, only tiff with this was that the sauce was pretty oily and started to separate after while), then sfogliatelle for dessert which was amazing.Overall, the service was fantastic and food was great. \u00a0Not to mention they do not have a dumbwaiter, so everything had to be brought up the stairs in the back, in the middle of July. \u00a0You would have never known though. \u00a0I will definitely return for a more casual dinner."], ["Tom D.", "My colleagues were a bit more impressed then I was. Of course it's tough to cook for the public and have it compare to my own Italian home cooking! This was not my first trip to this restaurant and like the first - I was certainly impressed by the menu and the pricing. Parking is pretty good, but you might be on the street or in the lot across the street - at least it's free!The place is normally packed at lunch time and this trip was no different, but they were able to get the 5 of us seated without wait and the cleanliness was good. There was something for everyone on the menu and I selected a Chicken pasta dish - forgive me for not remembering the name, but the reason this is a three star was because my chicken was a bit dry. I also thought there should have been more spinach and the angel hair pasta should have been tossed better to prevent it from sticking together without sauce - I really don't like that! I wasn't asked if I wanted more shaker cheese, the server seemed a bit put out and not very friendly - almost like we were in his way!Overall - I would certainly go back - try something else and maybe see if I could raise the rating, but for now - it's a solid 3 stars!"], ["Dezeree H.", "Since moving to the Midwest from the east 6 years ago, I have yet to find good Italian food. A coworker told me about this place and our visit was probably the best meal we've had in six years. \u00a0This place is like the authentic Italian food that you find in immigrant communities back east. Order anything and it will be excellent!"], ["Casey M.", "Came here this past weekend with my boyfriend. We loved it! There was a long line and a lot of people were complaining. But it was Saturday night, what do they expect? We had a reservation and had no problems getting seated. Their wine selection is good and not extremely expensive. We started off with their bread and Sicilian Garlic Dip. It was VERY garlicky--my boyfriend and I made a pact to just both stink that night. I had their special, Porcini Ravioli with Butter Sage Sauce. I NEED to make that sauce at home, it's to die for. Overall we had a great experience, but the ambiance left something to be desired. Due to the long wait, many people were rather sauced at the bar. They were loud and obnoxious and we had the misfortune of being seated right next to them. So romantic. Quick tip: ask to be seated in the main dining room."], ["Kevin S.", "When I have a taste for Italian in KC, Garozzo's downtown is a favorite. And for many in KC because it is usually very crowded - reservations are highly recommended. We have always had well mixed cocktails to start the evening followed by a wedge salad - the best I've had in KC - perfecto. They have a fairly extensive and reasonably priced wine selection. The dishes are tasty, although not innovative. The atmosphere is straight forward, decorated with family photos."], ["Faith B.", "I really want to like Garozzo's. BF loves it.We tried the Lee's Summit location and I was sadly disappointed in the service; the food was just okay,Everyone told me I had to try the original.I recently tried the Columbus Park original location for a lunch meeting. The service was very good and quite attentive and the waitress happily explained the menu.The bread pre-meal was warm and comforting.I liked the house Chianti.The salad was tasty and fresh.I loved the Cafe Garozzo we had at the end of the meal. Yummy! But my entree, the Eggplant Parmesan, was really just average. It makes me sad that I've had better at chains.I wonder if I'm missing out on the Garozzo's appeal because I don't order their meat dishes.Sigh."], ["Matthew L.", "Excellent food. Reasonable Prices. Fantastic atmosphere. Downtown italian joint theme. \u00a0Highly recommended."], ["Patrick V.", "Garozzo's knows Italian. \u00a0From my experience it's up there with some places on The Hill in STL. \u00a0I was looking for non-chain Italian place in KC to take my daughter to before we went to a show at Starlight for her birthday. \u00a0Yelped real quick and found Garozzo's and it was a date. \u00a0We arrived around 6:30pm on a Monday without a reservation and actually got seated right away by a table by the bar. \u00a0The service was superb and everyone was very professional. \u00a0When I thought I wanted the Three Way Pasta, our waitress mentioned it was a 6lb dish thankfully and pointed me towards the Capelli D'Angelo. \u00a0She knew I wasn't THAT hungry and she was right :) \u00a0My daughter got The Hill Special. \u00a0We also ordered some Garlic Cheese bread. \u00a0I mentioned we were in a bit of a rush to get to the show on time, and I am so impressed that the staff made sure the food came out promptly and took note that we were on a time constraint. \u00a0Our dishes came out in 15min or so and WOW were they good. \u00a0The D'Angelo was an amazing buttery angle hair pasta with fresh tomatoes which I added chicken too. \u00a0Just perfect if you aren't in the mood for a paste sauce. \u00a0Incredibly good. \u00a0My daughter really liked her dish as well. \u00a0Very generous portions, I only finished half of mine and ate the rest for two lunches days after :) \u00a0The daughter was the same. \u00a0We could of shared one dish and been full. \u00a0Overall, just an all around happy last minute find that turned out to be a great way to start out the evening. \u00a0It's on my list as a top Italian place in KC that I'll be taking my wife too soon! \u00a0Great job Garozzo's!"]]}
