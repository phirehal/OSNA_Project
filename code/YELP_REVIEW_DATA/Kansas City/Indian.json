I take off a star because I was not asked what I wanted to drink so I ended up drinking water rather my regular lunch drink of diet pop. Two types of rice which was nice. The chicken Marsala was perfectly spiced and the spinach paneer was excellent. I filled my plate with other delicious dishes but I didn't note the names, just tried everything that looked good.

I was craving some Indian cuisine the other night & we were going to head over to Seva's (the only Indian restuarant we've been to & we love) but seen a $10 for $20 deal on Yelp for Swagat. \u00a0I read through the reviews and all were short of perfect! \u00a0First of all, I want to mention how beautiful Zona Rosa is, the park & the atmosphere down there is worth the trip alone. \u00a0So upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by friendly staff & taken to our table. \u00a0I was distracted by the decor and beauty of this restaurant as we were lead to our table. \u00a0The architecture & effort that has been put into this place is outstanding and in a way romantic.So we ordered the Swagan dinner for 2 which comes with your house bread (crackers, cumin papad) and 3 sauces which I can't name all of them but I know one was mint chutney all in all delicsious & spicy! \u00a0Then came our hot indian lentil soup.. it was decent, not a huge fan of lentils. \u00a0Food comes out pretty quickly would be my only complaint. \u00a0It would of been nice to finish our appetizers first BUT they did ask if it was to soon & we didn't argue. \u00a0Our fresh naan was set on the table & the butter aroma coming from the naan was superb and made me even more anxious to try it. \u00a0Along came our chicken tikka masala, curry rogan josh lamb, basmati rice w/veggies and last but not least our tandoori chicken came out in a SIZZLING skillet. \u00a0Smelled wonderful, looked beautiful & tasted even better than I could have ever expected. \u00a0Spices & seasoning of the masala and curry were spot on and left me wanting more and more. \u00a0All my husband kept saying was mmmm, and didn't hear much from him until he said he was about to burst. \u00a0LOL! Also we tried the medium spicy, PERFECT! Anything spicier and I couldn't of handled the heat.. my husband maybe, I mean he does love ghost pepper cheese. \u00a0So, we wanted to keep eating just because the food was that deliscious and we knew our tummy's were at their capacity when we forgot we also get dessert with our meal for two. \u00a0So we box up our leftovers (made a tasty lunch the next day) and wait for our Galub Jamun which is a cheese dumpling basically in a sweet syrup. \u00a0SOOOO yummy! \u00a0We've had something similiar at Seva's. \u00a0Oh & I almost forgot about our vegetable samosas that came w/our lentil soup. \u00a0Basically a fried or baked pastry with wonderful fillings of peas, potatoes, beans ,etc & indian spices. \u00a0It was to die for especially made a perfect compliment with the lentil soup. \u00a0All in all our experience was beyond what we expected, the food was the best I've ever had aside from my gma's home cooking & I will be returning VERY soon! \u00a0Also will become our #1 Indian cuisine restaurant anytime we get a graving for real tastes of India.After leaving the restaurant we had heard of Spice Bazaar which is family owned by the owner of Swagat. \u00a0It's basically a little convenience store filled with indian spices, rices, beans, frozen naan, cumin papad, anything you can think of!!! We were thrilled to go in here b/c we got some of the very ingredients like Rogan Josh curry to make at home. \u00a0Loved the cumin papad so we bought some of that & it was all at a very reasonable price. \u00a0The spices were endless & smelt wonderful also at a decent price. \u00a0Can't wait to make another trip back here also. \u00a0I'd say after dinner @Swagat's your just destined to go to Spize Bazaar afterwards. Not sure how anyone could pass it up!"], ["Susan C.", "The manager kicked us out of our booth seat while we were still finishing up our dinner. His explanation was that there was another party waiting for booth seating. I understand that on a busy Friday evening, if there is a party that finished their food and is just chatting, that that could be rude and at that point, the manager has the right to ask the party to finish things up. However, when I am forced to take home the remainder of my dinner just because I was preventing the restaurant from seating another party sooner, that is unacceptable. However, it seems that only the waiters understood what it means to be polite.Hence, I do not plan to return to this restaurant with such poor customer service, no matter how great the food is."], ["Madelaine G.", "I might have dreams about this buffet.

My daughter doesn't do spicy very well at all, but still found enough to eat that she left stuffed and happy. She loved the Naan, veggie pakoras, tandoori chicken, and dessert.

I will happily go back.I'm a huge fan of Bhindi Masala, Bhindi Pakora, etc. I love okra. And I love creative things done with okra, from stuffed pods to the stewed okra and tomatoes of my Mississippi childhood. Kulture Kurry's okra dish - Bhindi Kurkuri - is different from any I've ever had. \u00a0It's thinly shaved and dry cooked with dried peppers. Its interesting texture (crunchy okra, chewy caramelized onions) and delicious flavor would recommend it even to people who say they don't like okra.The portions are large, served with basmati and papadum + chutney as an appetizer. I had chai (served unusually unsweetened) to drink, which was interesting, but still very good.This place is right around the corner from my work, and on the way home. I forsee many, many takeaway orders of the Bhindi Kurkuri in my future. On ambiance: The service was good, BoH was quick, and everything was delicious. The \"radio\" (spotify or another streaming service) is the only real annoyance. Because it's apparently running on someone's phone and plugged into the FoH speakers, you can hear anytime a text comes in.

Went here with a few friends a week back and were greeted to some wonderful indian food, the kind that hangs onto your clothes after and makes you need to take a shower to prevent anyone from knowing that you gorged on food for lunch.The price is nice, around 12 bucks for the lunch buffett and there was a great selection of dishes to choose from ranging from vegetarian to meat based which the vegetarians in our groups all appreciated. The korma, curry, and paneer were all delicious of different meat and vegetarian varieties. The service was excellent which probably helped because this was mid-week and we were some of the only people in the restaurant. I think a few of the things could possibly have been fresher but we were on the tail end of the lunch buffet so I would recommend going earlier during the lunch hours.Another odd thing for a restaurant is they close in between lunch and dinner which you don't often see, but it's definitely worth making a trip for lunch to try some of their Indian food which is some of the best I've had in the KC area so far."], ["Sarah N.", "It was alright. My husband and I decided to try it out because we kept hearing how good it was but it was mediocre at best. This place was empty when we came in at 6pm. I had the tikka masala and it was alright! It was mostly just sauce with little bits of chicken in it. It should've had way more meat in it, especially since it was $16 for just the tikka and a little bowl of rice. They don't allow substitutions for naan instead of rice which was a big let down because my husband prefers to eat his with naan instead of rice so we had to order extra naan. We are huge fans of Ruchi's and thought this place wouldn't be as expensive but it turned out to be more than what we would spend at Ruchi's. We won't be coming back here again.

It is located in a strip mall near Corporate Woods, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Luckily some friends had been there before, and vouched for the food. The interior is clean and a little spartan. The waitstaff has been good both times, but we stumped two different members of the staff with pretty basic questions about the dishes. The first time I went I got the Chicken Vindaloo. When the dish on the menu says \"hot and spicy\" don't ask for \"medium heat\". That is apparently added onto the base heat level of the dish. Other than my nose running at an alarming rate, the dish tasted great. I also got some garlic naan, which was tasty. My wife and I got the hummus tandoori as an appetizer. It was really good! Basically just hummus served with diced tandoori chicken on top.The second time I went, I decided to try the Kansas Krackle. The menu describes it as \"assorted meats\" and \"served over rice\", but it was just chicken in three styles served over some onion. I assumed I had read it wrong on the menu, and didn't take it up with the waiter. The meat was good, and I ate it with naan. A member of our party said I was eating \"Indian fajitas\", which is a good way to describe it. Kitchen missteps aside, it was tasty. For our appetizer this time, we tried the Chicken 1947. I didn't have a problem with the dish, but it did taste a lot more Asian than I expected. Overall, good experiences both times, and I'd recommend checking it out."], ["Aarushi G.", "You are greeted by the smell of delicious Indian food and pretty decor as soon as you enter.

The dal makhni was was also delicious, although not quite as authentic as the very dark brown version rich in butter and cream, which is how it is served in India. The spice flavors were on the spot. We also tried the aloo tikki chaat and it was good, but not quite like the street-style chaat that is served in India.

Great, delicious food and our server was very nice. Get the tandoori lettuce chicken wraps, they weren't super spicy, but the flavor of the chicken was pretty darn good. I'll just list out the rest:-Chicken Dhabi (chicken in a tomato sauce) was mild, but the chicken was tender and the dark meat was super juicy. The sauce wasn't too think or too thin.-My husband had the Railway Goat Curry and he loved it. They leave the bones in so be careful (for flavor?)-Complementary long grain rice (with every dish)-Portion sizes were perfectI loved this place and I love the modern Indian decor.

For example the chicken dhaba tasted VERY different both times it was ordered.My review for our to-go order:- Naan: not too fluffy but it was good 4/5- Mutton biryani: we said mild and it was still super spicy. Family said it was better the first time they ordered. According to my experience 4/5- Chicken dhaba: now I don't know what this is really supposed to be so I can't give it a fair review. But whatever it was, it was pretty good 4/5- Chicken makhani: in my opinion it had a weird sweet flavor to it and when you eat it with naan or rice, felt like it had no flavor 3/5- raita: had the onions and tasted JUST OK. it was more watery than a lassi so we didn't get to eat it with our food. 1/5- Good portion of plain rice. I am not going to rate it. Glad it was cooked well.Overall decent for Kansas but food lacks the authentic flavor of Indian food and they are super expensive! Our bill came out to $53.00.

FYI I am a pretty heavy eater and so were the other two adults with me, but after we were finished with the entrees, we had zero space for a desert, which sounded really tempting, but I didn't want to tempt fate :PAll in all, if you're ever on college boulevard, or at another Indian restaurant in the locality that you're bored of going to/ pissed off with the wait, make the trip down college blvd to the \"New kid on the block\"Kulture Kurry, stay cool, stay sharp, and make sure all your patrons walk out with full stomachs, just the way I did.

Just when I thought it couldn't get better, they brought out my rich, spicy dish of chicken tika masala served with fluffy, perfectly cooked basamati rice, I thought I'd died and gone to the Taj Mahal! I ate my fill, but I just had to try the Narangi Nasha for dessert, and I'm glad I did--cool, creamy, and refreshing, and a perfect palate cleanser after the rich sauce.

I miss Tony. \u00a0Let's not get bogged down with sadness though... let's talk about the good stuff.I don't know correct food terminology and I'm not going to fake it.... \u00a0Call me unrefined, I don't care. \u00a0I will use descriptors to name the food. \u00a0No offense intended to anyone.So they have brown sauce with taters and brown sauce with meat (goat).

The sauce has a really nice flavor that isn't overwhelmed by either the tomato or cream, the chicken has that great dry tandoori quality to it (that I love), and the spice levels - even if you order it hot - isn't overwhelming, but instead tends to build in intensity as you eat more.On the weekends, they do thali specials - one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian - that lets you sample a couple entrees, a selection of sides, rice pudding, some sauces, and a samosa and naan bread, all for a decent price and - if time is an issue - relatively quick turn around. I prefer the vegetarian option as I'm rarely in the mood for lamb, although the non-veg version always has their excellent tikka masala as the chicken dish.Their basic naan bread is probably my favorite in KC, although Korma Sutra and Ruchi have good bread as well. I believe I've tried most of the appetizers, and they've all been good, although I think Korma Sutra's appetizers are a bit better overall.As for other dishes, again, they've always been good. My friends prefer their butter chicken over other restaurants, and in my opinion their rice is really good, close but possibly a little better than even Korma Sutra's. And when I'm not ordering the tikka masala, I'm usually ordering the tandoori chicken or the chicken tikka (e.g. the tikka masala minus the sauce). Both are great options that I usually get if I'm not up for the heaviness of the masala.During the week they have a buffet. I've only been there once, and remember it being good if a bit small. However, I'll defer to others with more experience to judge the weekday buffet options.BEVERAGESI basically stick to water whenever I do Indian - I don't want my drink to distract from the wonderful flavors, and fresh water always taste better when you're indulging in a little spice.Judging by the bottles behind the cash register, they seem to have a decent selection of alcohol, but again, I've never tried any and can't really say how it compares to other restaurants.I have had their mango lassi, which is good.SERVICEThe service is definitely top notch - the servers tend to be quiet and keep your beverages refilled but otherwise \"stay out of the way\". As such, their service is different than Korma Sutra's, where the owner is very engaging and even entertaining.Which is better is personal preference. Personally, I like both. There are times where me and my party really enjoy the engaging environment of Korma Sutra, but other times where it's nice to have the much more relaxed and quiet environment of Touch of Asia.If anything, the slight edge (for me) goes to Touch of Asia in this regard, because it really does feel like your neighborhood Indian restaurant, where the owner recognizes you, you get familiar with most of the servers, and you can just relax without having to worry about a seven-course entertainment for the evening. :)OVERALLAs I've said, I love Touch of Asia as it is basically a consistently good place for Indian food in a low-key setting. I've done plenty of take-out from them, but it's a fantastic place to get together with friends and spend an hour or two over good food and conversation.It may not have the buffet options of some places, or the engaging style of service of others, but it really is a fantastic restaurant in its own right, a nice neighborhood joint that's great for a weekday night meal with friends or family."], ["Graham G.", "I've been a fan of Indian fan since my youth, introduced to it by my Dad who loves Indian food. I didn't experience truly great (westernized) Indian restaurants until I lived in England, where Indian food is king.My work colleages and I regularly visit other Indian restaurants in the area for lunch. Namely Korma Sutra and Marsala's, I'd been trying to convince them for sometime to try a Touch of Asia, today we finally did.Prior to today I had eaten at this restaurant once, about 3-4 years ago, after enjoying a great lunch buffet, I'm puzzled why it didn't become a regular after that first visit.When I saw Samosa on the buffet I was sold, it's one of my all-time favorites, although on a buffet they're often not that good. These on the other hand were very good, better than some I've had cooked to order.In addition to the Vegetable Somosa, they had a good range of dishes available with something everyone should enjoy, even those who are not familiar with Indian food.Each dish we tried was flavorful and the meats were very tender, something you don't typically find on a buffet. Both of us were very impressed and have vowed to return on a regular basis.The service wasn't quite as attentive, even though it was quiet, as that of Korma Sutra, who's service is unsurpassed and can't be beaten on the little extras they provide. The Naan was a little disappointing too and took a while to arrive at the table. These minor flaws were more than made up for by the excellent food!"], ["Madelaine G.", "Food was good, service friendly and attentive.

Five of us were seated at a table that was probably not big enough for all the dishes that would soon be presented, but like clowns in a clown car we made it work. I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo (delicious and spicy, but the lamb had some fat and/or ligaments that I wish would have been removed prior to cooking). I also sampled the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is probably the most popular dish among non-Indians. It was tasty, and the medium spice level was probably a little hotter than some might prefer. Again, the chicken breast could've been trimmed better, as there was a little of what I would assume to be rib meat pieces. The rice that came with both dishes was very good, but they only have one type--basmati. They have plenty of naan options, and the garlic naan we had was delicious. Service was better than average.

The paneer butter masala tasted like it had 50% water (I could see water separated on the top). I have had this before and enjoyed this, but this time it was terrible. Half the briyani box had chunks of just white rice and there was very little masala. I hope they don't spoil the franchise name."], ["Brent K.", "spicier than most, it was a fairly quiet afternoon buffet, I can't say that it was anything special, though the Naan was brought out fresh, as well as a bowl of Biriyani, which was a nice touch. \u00a0slightly more expensive than other buffets. \u00a0the waiters & waitresses were constantly filling water and clearing plates which was nice as well. \u00a0that may have been because it was so empty. \u00a0personally liked Masalas which occupied this space before a little better.i got the goat Biriyani and it was chock full of bones. \u00a0it made eating it nearly impossible. boo on that."], ["Dhananjay C.", "I loved the Biryani here. Being from Hyderabad, I can tell you the flavor is authentic, though spicy for the American palette. The servers are very polite and attentive. I would have gladly given the place five stars had it not been for two things: 1. It takes a while for the Biryani to arrive. But that might just be the nature of cooking the dish right. 2. Something I wanted on the menu wasn't available at that time. I loved how they value and care for the customer. Good food and decent ambience make me want to go back and take some friends along."], ["Beatrice B.", "Would give zero stars if it was possible. Both times I ordered delivery they were over two hours LATE. Food arrived lukewarm at best. Every time I called for an update they asked me to call back 5-10 minutes later and on the very next call pretended to not have just spoken to me about my late order. Poor management, what a shame"], ["Anna K.", "This is really the place to go for good Indian food and great serviceI really love the way the waiter absolutely takes care of you and everyone there is on their feet filling up the buffet as neededGood variety of food as wellWe will go there again"], ["Kunal S.", "Update: Taking off 1 star because the quality of biryani is not consistent. Last couple of times, I felt the lamb was chewy and the biryani was very spicy. This place has undoubtedly the best goat biryani in KC! My another favorite is the Goat pepper fry. I hope they keep up with the consistency and I will come here again and again."], ["David B.", "I've been to this restaurant twice now - once for the famous Paradise Biriyani and then for the lunch buffet. I have to say, so far I'm really impressed with the quality of the food.Biriyani - Its has much more masala and flavor than biriyanis offered by other Indian restaurants, has very good chicken:rice ratio, is offered in 3 different spice levels and has enough quantity to make you feel full. 4/5. But its not of that \"mouth-watering\" quality like Oklahoma Joe's barbeque that you should travel 20 or 30 miles just to get the biriyani.Lunch Buffet - They have your standard choice of menu items, is a little spicier than other Indian restaurants and they refill faster than some of the other places I've been to. So far, the food feels fresh and juicy :) A+++ . Although @12$ (weekday) and 15$(weekend) rates, this might feel like the costliest buffet in all of Overland Park, it worth going to once in a while.But I'm keeping my fingers crossed. All the Indian restaurants seem to open great and then fall away in quality gradually. Take K.Kurry restaurant for example. So I'll update this review after some months to see where it stands..For now 4.5/5 (unfortunately Yelp accepts only integers)EDIT: I can't believe this, but they managed to TOP their already high standards so much that I'm upgrading my rating to full 5/5. They've reached a point where the system (buffet, carry out ) has been perfected and is seamless. The biriyani is now always at the same extraordinary taste level and is consistent everytime. My friends go every week to their place (traveling 15-20 miles) for their Chicken biriyani and/or Goat pepper fry. They have changed their buffet system to cater more to the needs of the customers. Now you can order any biriyani you want from your table (during the buffet), and they'll bring it to you. You can keep ordering any number of times, but trust me, you can't go more than one serving of Chicken Biriyani & one serving of Goat Biriyani.Speaking of biriyani, I just absolutely love their flavor. Chilli and Spice has been losing a steady stream of customers even though their standard is still the same. Can't say I blame them. To stay on top, you gotta beat the best :)Tip : If you want Indian spicy level, order the medium or the maximum level because to me the lowest level always feel bland."]]}
