Only three other tables were seated, and another server seemed to have all of those tables. We felt as if we were inconveniencing the guy to be there. He wouldn't have had to make so many trips if he asked what we needed and remembered to bring more than one thing at a time. He mumbled that if we asked for more salsa, we'd be charged for them. So, keep in mind, 2 bowls of salsa is all that is allowed per a table of five adults. Their prices are outrageous enough, certainly not worth it. I had two .99 charges on my tab, which I assumed was the salsa. But, my mom also had a $1.99 charge that we never figured out.

The Pork Oxaca is one of my favorites. We always bring out of town guests. The service is quick and friendly and they start to recognize you after you've been in a few times. Delicous. Amazing.

It was a smokey sweet chipotle sauce, next time ask for it on the side. It was on the small side but beautifully prepared with large chunks of tilapia and avocado on a bed of rice and black beans. Sprinkled with fresh queso. My fella was thoroughly impressed by the shrimp tacos, tasting better than they looked. My margarita was big and beautiful with just the right amount of sass.

I was surprised though at the food, which is more bar tex-mex food than it is actual Mexican food. Their queso is good and velveeta-y, but comes in a tiny bowl that will only last you half the chips. Their tacos are loaded with meat & goodies, soft tortillas, and their quesadillas are probably my favorite. Grilled just enough so you get a bit of crunch and loaded with the perfect ratio of meat, cheese, and veggies. They have a large selection of nachos to choose from, as if the chips and queso we ordered weren't enough. Nachos are decently loaded with the fixin's although I could use a bit more load.

In fact, they don't even have red or green chiles in the restaurant. The flavor added to their food can only be described as boring. \u00a0There was next to nothing added to the raw ingredient. I wonder if they even salted the meat they used...?Secondly, we ordered their chips and guacamole as an appetizer. \u00a0The guacamole was obviously frozen, had blackish spots, and had a huge avocado in the bottom of it that wasn't 'blended.' \u00a0Grade: D-. \u00a0The food we ordered (6 types of tacos) were all underwhelming. \u00a0They had zero flavor profile, lacked essential Mexican spices, and the sauces were pathetic.

This isn't just any taco bar however, the tacos are also cleverly crafted. I personally got the Taco Choice option on the menu for $7.99 which is any three soft tacos with rice and beans which is incredibly filling! I ordered the shrimp, tilapia, and pulled pork. Each taco has a unique savory flavor. My tacos had a lot of cabbage on them, so much so it was hard to see all the ingredients, but delicious none the less. I was not a huge fan of the tilapia taco specifically but it was not bad by any means, just not my particular favorite. The rice had a great flavor but the beans just didn't do it for me. You are definitely paying for the delicious tacos not the sides. We also got the .99 cent chips and salsa as an appetizer and the salsa was really flavorful and the chips were fresh and warm! Well worth the buck for that.While the bar may feel small, the staff is definitely friendly. We were taken care of very well the entire time we were there and while they weren't full, they had a lot of customers for a weekday evening. We felt like they definitely were attentive and helpful at every turn. Their tap selection isn't what I would pick but they do have a lot of Mexican beers on tap which is pretty different and unique. They did have a lot of great craft beer in bottles though including a lot from Odell.The only thing I didn't care for was the crowd did pick up while we were finishing up, and in a small area like that with everyone packed in, it got pretty loud but hey it's a bar what do you expect!

So I kept driving by this place and kept seeing the sign that read 4 tacos for $2.99, I was on the hook just like the Drunken Worm!

My waiter asked if I wanted hot sauce, I said yes please and he proceeds to bring me a tool box full of different types of Tabasco like sauces, I then proceeded to ask for real Mexican hot salsa which he brought promptly.

It doesn't look like much from the outside and it's squeezed in-between two other bars. I normally frequent the Hi-Dive Lounge next door but today we were up for something different and I'm so glad. So. Drunken Worm is a hole in the wall bar wall with lots of Mexican decor and TV for sports. It's a sports/tequila bar if there is such a thing. The decor is definitely more south of the border than sports bar, so I appreciated that. They have nightly specials too. I was there on a Sunday (Easter at that) and they had specialty shots for $3. \u00a0The bartender was super friendly and the place was crowded but not packed.

Hubby ordered the tamales and thought they were very tasty. Our only negative comment would be that there was quite a delay between when his tamales were brought to the table and when my tacos showed up.

I prefer flour and I think they were corn. This dish came with beans and rice so I left full and satisfied. This time I got the enchiladas pollo. It was served in a little skillet about 6\" in diameter so they weren't that big. This, coupled with the lack of beans and rice left me hungry when I left. No chips and salsa included either. I was going to order the chips and guac to make up for what my main dish lacked in volume, but passed after I saw they were $8.

The service is never on it's top game because the wait staff seems stretched too thin for how packed the place is. It's not terrible, but not great either. The drinks are good, usually strong. The last time I was here I had the watermelon mint margarita, which was the perfect drink for a hot summer day. Food can be hit or miss. I've ordered the fried oyster tacos for a few different dinners now and have had different quality come out each time (a bummer since I'd expect something like tacos to easy to keep consistent).

In truth, most of the filling was rice with a few pieces of moist and tender chicken, accented by smattering of corn and black beans. The chimichanga \u00a0was fried crispy, but I found that the bottom of the tortilla was difficult to cut through, even with a knife. This is a small chimichanga by anyone's standards, perhaps 4 inches long and round.

She up-sold us on some chorizo appetizer that was'nt good. The chorizo was brunt to the bottom of the skillet and we had to scrap the pan with our forks the entire time.Their saving grace was the entree.

The interior is unique. \u00a0This is not the typical Mexican food you are used to, which is probably why I love it and possibly why it has mediocre ratings? It's higher priced than most places in the area but you're getting high quality food, so for me, it's totally worth it. \u00a0My mom and I sat at the bar for a little while and sampled some margaritas. I had the pear serano which was spicy and sweet, my favorite of the evening. \u00a0I also sampled the jalapeno apricot and prickly pear margarita, \u00a0also both delicious. We started with the pork rinds with guacamole. They were crackling while they came out on the plate. I remember my grandma buying these when I was a kid and thinking how gross they were. Times have changed! I couldn't get enough of these. They were deep fried but light and fluffly. The had some sort of ranch spice that kicked up their flavor. My mom and I split the squash blossoms and panza (favorite of the evening). They came with warm tortillas which were surprisingly filling. The panza had pork that literally melted when you cut it with a fork, smothered in a mole sauce with chorizo. It also came with a sweet, \u00a0cinnamon covered plantain - sweet and spicy together is the best combination and I feel the menu really used some unique ingredients to make great dishes. We asked the bartender why there was Blackhawks gear and were told the restaurant was inspired from the owner living in Chicago. Yeah...I knew there was a reason I liked this place. Thank god that Kansas City is making a name for itself in the restaurant scene!

We had three items: Eggs Benedict served over biscuits, a cheeseburger that came on a sugary pink bun, and a spicy, meaty soup. Of the three, the eggs were the best but nothing a reasonably talented home cook could not make. The soup was very odd. You needed a fork and knife to cut up the stringy, water-logged, slightly burnt \"grilled\" vegetables. Also 2 large pieces of corn on the cob floated in the soup. There was no way to eat them, so they just bobbed around like life preservers bringing nothing to the party in terms of flavor. Finally, let's talk about the cheeseburger. I am a fan of stinky cheese, but this was not stinky cheese. This was objectionable cheese with an overpowering odor. The meat was good, but combine the awful cheese with the donut bun (The inspiration for some Jim Gaffigan Donut Hamhambuger references) and you end up with a fail. We did not try any drinks -- the Bloody Marys looked good -- so maybe the bar is worthwhile. But avoid brunch."], ["Maddie K.", "Great atmosphere. We had a nice waitress that was very knowledgeable about the menu. We never felt rushed while we were eating, but the hostess told us that they had reservations in and hour and 15min and would need the table she was about to seat is at and then said that was probably plenty of time to eat...

Port Fonda is more American fusion Mexican. This place is on the expensive side, Carne Asada was $15; the whole dish was the same size as the container that warm tortillas are served in. Everything tasted sour to me also. The salsa was okay, the rice and beans were bland. Felt like \u00a0I was paying for the atmosphere than the food. I was really hoping to like this place, but I probably wouldn't come back. I'd suggest Port Fonda for those who like small eats, happy hour, loud hipster-yuppie places.

It looked like our kind of joint--new vibe, Mexican food. We couldn't have possibly been more disappointed after our visit. Not only was it loud, but whoever was in charge of the music continually changed the station mid-song. It was distracting and annoying.The portion sizes are a joke. We started with chips & salsa. Two tiny bowls of over-pureed salsa with a handful of chips, for $5. As soon as this came, we knew we were set up for a disappointing meal.He ordered the San Antonio Special, which was a tamale big enough for a Chihuahua treat. Just like the \u00a0chips, over priced.I ordered the carnitas tacos. 15 minutes after he was given (and finished with) his entree--no one said anything about where my tacos were--we flagged down our waitress & asked where they were. She said \"oh they must be working on them still.\" Working on putting together two tiny tacos with pre-prepared ingredients? Doubtful. While I waited, she brought me a ridiculously small portion of bland rice and beans. Thanks?Finally, 2 tiny, under-seasoned tacos that would barely even fill a small child arrived...for $12. I could've (should've?) gone to the store and purchased an entire pork shoulder and all of the ingredients to make carnitas myself for less than the $12 I spent on these.Despite paying over $40 (thank God we ordered waters, because with the way things went, I can only imagine a coke would've cost $5 without refills) for lunch, we were still hungry when we left.If you want to pay way too much for what you get just so that you can feel like a super cool hipster while you instagram it, put on your ironic T-shirt and head to Port Fonda.Had the service been even halfway decent, we might've just never returned.

They're certainly of the Mexican persuasion, and the food that I had was delicious, as was that of all of my dinner guests. But I would be hard pressed to refer to any of our meals as traditional Mexican. I enjoyed a ridiculously good meatball sandwich, and my dining partner chowed down on a sandwich of fried pork tenderloin. Both were just stupid good. Another friend enjoyed his mushroom sandwich, which I didn't try because....blegh mushrooms are gross!!!!! He sure liked it, however.Seriously, everything here was rad. My only, ONLY complaint was that all of our meals came with a side of fried pork skin, and while I tried to be game, ultimately it just wasn't good. We all had maybe two or three pieces, and donated 4/5 of our side to the compost heap. They just weren't appetizing. Other quick notes:1) gorgeous interior2) rockin' hostess. She's the best!3) I dig the art, specifically that on the way to the bathroom4) Crazy good drinks, but train your staff to not try and talk you out of ordering certain cocktails.

Tried the house special pulled pork chimichanga served in a \"creme sauce\" which ain't Tex-Mex but was very tasty and recommended regardless (without the creme sauce). To help overcome my lack of spice, waitress brought a homemade habanero creamy carrot sauce (not salsa) and it went beautifully with chimichanga too and it did have plenty of heat!

I have been more than a few times and haven't struck out on anything to this point. I even went during a Paleo-diet month of March and was able to enjoy pork rinds and guac along with my meal.

The location and the head chef were definitely hyped before opening and as far as I can tell, the hype has rightfully continued. Port Fonda has established itself as a go-to Westport destination for drinks and eats. Whether day or night, there always seems to be a crowd of happy people. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and more than happy to make recommendations should you be brave enough to dive into the more interesting tequilas and mezcals the bar offers. Specifics are more fun anyway so lets dive in.The first thing I tried here was the Sopa Port Fonda and what a first it was. This dish is RICH and undeniably flavorful. It's also a pretty damn heavy meal for a \"soup.\" Loaded with pork belly, pork butt, chochoyotes and polished off with a fried egg, it has about everything you could ask for. Good luck finishing it all! This is perfect cold weather food.Fonda's enchiladas are perfectly cooked and carry with them a little spice. The poblano cream provides a perfect balance between spice and flavor and the entire thing just melts in your mouth. Lastly, the tacos. All three options are perfectly proportioned to fill you up and the flavors in each are balanced by pineapple or salsa depending on which direction you decide to go. Each come with a side of rice and beans which probably aren't that necessary unless you're ordering these after having a few of their drinks - at which point, the extra filling carbs might be right up your alley. Fonda's house margaritas are par for the course and rival El Patron in terms of potency. For those with braver palettes, the pineapple serrano margarita is an awesome combo of sweet and spicy.To really enjoy the unique aspect of Port Fonda, put on your brave pants and saddle up at the bar. Ask the bartender to introduce you to some finer tequilas or induct you into the world of mezcal. There are some truly unique and interesting flavors out there to enjoy and so much better than the average swill most people shoot when they order a tequila out. Can't say enough about this spot, so ensure it's on your list. You'll no doubt have an excellent experience."], ["Tim M.", "Okay I went again. Everything was really good. But I just don't understand why such a relatively new restaurant keeps changing the menu. The amazing tempura vegetables are gone. We were able to find somewhat decent substitutes, but apparently these didn't sell well. Ordered a little bit of everything, and all of it was good. But damn, I miss those vegetables. Some have said it is too loud (the music) and I don't doubt it. But I do crave the food, and I try to go early before the volume gets out of control.

El Patron serves up some of the best you'll find in the city. The tamales are quite tasty, but I've recently strayed away from them in favor of the chicken mole burrito. It's tough to beat a mountain of meat, beans, and cheese drenched in chocolatey, peppery mole. Yum! The grilled steak dishes are also not to be missed. Of note, the house salsas are really good and taste very fresh. As others have noted, the drinks here are freakin' awesome. They're a tad on the pricy side ($7 for a margarita or mojito), but you get what you pay for. Coming during happy hour lowers the price to a much more reasonable (and dangerous) $4 and opens up half-price apps for you, as well. Tough to argue with that!Again, I don't get the Tex-Mex craving very often, but El Patron is at the top of my go-to list when I do."], ["Phil Z.", "We decided to try this joint after driving by many times. We had a bad feeling as soon as we walked in. The carpet on the stairs was filthy and the walls were covered in stains and scratches. The downstairs dining room was full and we were ushered upstairs to our table. The host was very nice and so was the waiter. But, the place is dirty! My wife noticed a huge white stain \u00a0on the inside of her water glass after drinking half of it. It appeared to be dried sour cream. Gag! The table was sticky and covered in dried food. The area near the bathroom was also very dirty and the floor felt greasy under my feet. The food was OK, but everything was bland. The board of health needs to pay a visit to this place, quickly!"], ["Michael P.", "After numerous trips here, I've finally settled in enough to write a review. El Patron is one of many options for Mexican cuisine on the Blvd and clearly one of the better ones. Nothing against the other eateries, but EP seems to put a little more care and flair into their dishes. Yesterday's bistec ranchero was as solid as their other speciality fare. Honestly, you can't really go wrong here as they provide all the regular options and then some for your dining pleasure. I wish, however, they would have more options like chili verde or Colorado, or a carne asada platter. For those watching their gluten intake and carbs (you probably shouldn't be eating Mexican after all) EP only has one or two options. A knock I have on EP is their limited seating. Long waits are normal on weekend nights and there isn't a good place to stand while waiting. I hate waiting for a table while standing a foot from another diner's dinner. God forbid I have to sneeze....or worse. Seating and standing room aside, EP is legit. Don't think twice about giving this awesome joint a shot for lunch or dinner."], ["Rhonda S.", "Humongous tacos...which means, the size of half a dinner plate! I was thinking, what would be my 100th review on Yelp? Let's make it huge! I loved El Patrons so much last Tuesday for our event, I returned this Tuesday. I swear the tacos for only $1,50 were bigger than the one's they served at the event...Size really does matter. Time does too. We got there at 5:00, with no problems parking.They bring you the sauce and chips to the table with an exhaustive menu. I'm used to higher end Mexican food, so the prices were no different than where I normally eat.. Their mild sauce is one of my favorites in the city. Their hot sauce doesn't have much hotness, just enough to taste some heat.I ordered 2 fried tacos and Mexican rice. They brought out a plate with these huge over sized monster tacos on fried flour shells. I could only eat one, and half the rice. I had to get a to go box. The ground beef is perfectly seasoned, cheese hefty, and lettuce, with a couple of tomato chunks. I didn't see anything sweet on their menu.

It's hard to say what that really means because the Mexican food I've had here has been mediocre at best. My friends and I all ordered frozen mango margaritas, which quickly separated so that the frozen part was at the top and the bottom was all liquid-y. They were, however, HUGE and tasted pretty good. I ordered a taco trio - a fish taco, carne asade and carnitas. The carne asade was by far the best. The other two were meh. The tortillas were not very good, I ended up just eating the insides out of them. The meal also came with rice and beans. It was a ton of food. Lastly, I was disappointed with the chips - not flavorful and cold.

Their margaritas are strong and delicious, easily trumping those you'll find at most other Boulevard spots. Sure, they have upgraded fancy margaritas, but when you make house margaritas as good as this, there's no reason to spend the extra money. They're even cheaper during happy hour. Now let's talk about food: Get the fish tacos. With massive slices of avocado and mango salsa, they are guaranteed to make you happy. They say they are \"Award Winning\", and while I have no idea what award that might be, I'm willing to believe it. Also highly recommended: the Parrillada El Patron, essentially a tabletop grill that allows you to make some sort of taco/fajita hybrid. It's a lot of fun to get one of these for 4 people, and at less than $50, the price is definitely right.

It kind of made me want to go and sit at the bar. They seated me in the back room, at the back booth. I got my menu as soon as I sat down. Last night, they had troubles with the blinds, and the sun shown right in my eyes. No problem, I just switched booth sides, then I found myself staring at a blank boring wall. Their salsa s not too hot that you can't taste it. The chips are free, as is the salsa. Their specials are really worth it. A burrito, on Thursday, is only 4.19. It is very inexpensive, and certainly beats Taco Bell by a long shot. This is the original Margaritas, with the water mark where it flooded. The parking is a bit narrow (I'm a baby when it comes to parallel parking, I cannot do it, \u00a0and I'm scared to death of \u00a0trying it.)

This guy doesn't offer frills, doesn't offer small talk...he just cuts through the bullshit and gets you fed and back on the road. He wouldn't do so well at a romantic steakhouse, but at a Taco Tuesday, he hits the mark. Daniel gets us in and out in 20-25 minutes. Quite remarkable when he is taking care of 15 tables during the lunch rush. Before you can open your menu, he greets you with \"what are we drinkin?\" and \"what are we eatin?\" as he knows it is Taco Tuesday and he is about to serve up 4 waters and 8 tacos. The man is on a mission. He is on the ready with a refill of salsa when you have only consumed 10% of your salsa. On one particular occasion, he actually \"refilled\" my coworker's salsa before he had even taken a bite. That is service.Watching Daniel in action is like watching Monet painting a landscape or Peyton Manning in a regular season game.

Hell, it would normally turn this one-star food rating into a three overall, but I just can't bring myself to do it. \u00a0So, in the spirit of starting with the positive, I will say that our waitress was nice and the bus staff were prompt with bringing what we needed.That's where the good ends, I'm afraid, for any place that can serve a chile relle\u00f1o as awful as the one I had the other night does not deserve to be classified as a Mexican restaurant. I know, you may not believe me. I've been cranky all week, what with having limited eating abilities. For those not keeping up (or reading this review out of sequence): I had a lot of dental work, including a wisdom tooth extraction several days ago. Eating isn't much fun these days. But! It does mean I can eat foods that are a bit more sinful because it involves such an uncomfortable effort, that I end up eating 1/4 of the serving. In other words, bring on the guacamole (the only thing that tasted good).And goddamn if I don't deserve a margarita served up in a pint glass.Or not, if they come from Margaritas. How can it be this bad? Even if made with well tequila (which it wasn't). How can a margarita made with Sauza Hornitos be this bad? But it was. I just don't get how a bartender in a Mexican restaurant can't do this one specialty drink right (especially considering it's its namesake?!) I presume that you need to think twice anytime you see slushie machines behind the bar and a drink menu that features sickeningly sweet fruity margaritas. I'm sorry. A travesty. You might as well go to 7-11 and get a strawberry Slurpee and dump some tequila into it.But let's get back to that excuse of a chile relle\u00f1o. Utterly unacceptable.I ordered two items off the a la carte menu because I wasn't sure if I was getting a straight answer when I told the waitress I was a vegetarian, so I wasn't about to bother with rice and beans that could possibly be made with chicken stock and/or pork fat. I mean, when I told her I was a veg, I was met with no response whatsoever. I felt as though I had stepped into a time warp and was at an El Torito circa 1990. To be safest here, you can order a cheese enchilada, a chille relle\u00f1o or a taco without meat so that basically you're getting some of the ingredients of a taco, while paying the same price as if you ordered it with the chicken, meat or fish. And let it be known, the potato soft taco I ordered contains the saddest ingredients to ever inhabit a flour tortilla. The chile relle\u00f1o at Margartias is described as coming with a mole or verde sauce. It arrived looking shriveled and sorry on the plate, no sauce, no cheese on top. If I hadn't spent the day trying to force down sips of unappetizing food, I don't see myself ever allowing such a thing in my mouth. It looked like a a giant cocoon. When I notified the waitress that there was no sauce on my relle\u00f1o, she indicated that I could use the mild salsa on the table (really?!) or order some spicy verde salsa, I chose the latter. To be fair, the verde was a bit spicy and flavorful. Still, it could not help that relle\u00f1o, which was edible only because I was starving.

For 7 years, I avoided this place like the plague (or like someone assuming this place would give you a plague) until my Latino/a friends said, \"no man, it's good.\" They were right. It is surprisingly good. Yes, you're going to get some gristle, and yes, some of their items might hit you like a brick, but when eating it in moderation I feel full, satisfied, and all warm and fuzzy inside. On my inaugural trip, I had the carne asada smothered burrito. For $5 you get a huge burrito, rice, and beans. Definitely enough for two meals. Asada was good, but did have gristle. The smother sauce was abundant and delicious. They have tortas (sandwiches), burritos, plates, tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, etc. Their menu is large and there are lots of delicious and cheap things to choose from. Pancho's is perfect for a night cap or a fast food Mexican craving. It may not be perfect for speediness, your figure, or your intestines. Summary: Don't be scarrrrrrred. Try Pancho's. It's legit.

You get what you pay for; if you came here expecting 4 star delicacies with fresh farm grown ingredients from their backyard community farm you should immediately re-evaluate your expectations. If you've come to Cancun for quick, cheap, and delicious late-night food for under $7 you are at the right place.- TASTE. The food serves a purpose. A quick meal, with a lot of meat, and a fairly appetizing taste. There is nothing original about the way the food is prepared or served, it is just a good 'ol late night burrito shop with no-frills or unnecessary niceties. -SAUCE. Again. Nothing OUT OF THIS WORLD, but it is unlimited and 'pour as you like', which in my book is always a win. The sauce comes in 4 'hotness' levels and the range covers all the necessary pallets. - CLEAN. Although this place is a hole in the wall, low-cost, late night eatery there is no reason it can't be clean. The bathroom was not filled with unpleasant smells, stagnant pools of liquid, or streaks of a questionable nature. It was a tidy bathroom and when an establishment gets (what should be a very basic formality in operating a public establishment) correct, it automatically garners some of my respect.Cons:- EXPECTATIONS. Although this place is currently sitting at a 4/5 rating on yelp, you should not go in expecting culinary greatness. It is good for what it is, and that is (like I've said numerous times before) a late night, 5 beers in, quick place to grab a hearty meal.

The carnitas was overcooked, hard and crunchy. I love nachos so I was hoping for better luck but was quickly disappointed. The cheese sauce was very strange and tasted like a ranch dressing that has cream added to it. There was also a strange yellow cheese substance that was a cross between real cheese and cheese whiz.

All the great, strong flavors you expect from good Mexican street food are there. No complaints from me on that level. The sauces that accompany the tacos are good but nothing outstanding. \u00a0If you come here, I'd advise against any of the more Tex-Mex options. The house chips and salsa are, frankly, pretty gross.

The food was not phenomenal and I've definitely had better Mexican in Omaha. I'd say the food was just OK but nothing spectacular! I think the salsa could be better as well.

I will say that my margarita was fantastic!"], ["Trev W.", "Average Tex MexLocated on the edge of the Plaza, Chuys is upstairs, yet you can enter around the back.Not really much to report here. The decor feels really dated, the cutlery was served in sanitized packets and the servers are slammed to the point where they were serving the wrong dishes to the wrong tables.The food tasted like plastic! The soft tacos I order were average at best. The chips that were severed with the meal broke apart even just to pick up.The one star is because the server was very niceOverall:Forget it"], ["TJ L.", "Good food! Fun atmosphere!

Lots of art on the walls. All in all it feels very comfortable. - views of the plaza fountain with some outside seating. - Staff was friendly, knowledgable and very attentive.- Amazing food!!!

They used to have the wonderful Nacho Bar but not sure why they took it down when it made the business more busy. It's a perfect bar for a huge gathering.

To be honest, I had some hesitations about going because I'm not a big fan of Tex-Mex (or chains).But Chuy's won me over.The decor is over-the-top bright and a little loud, but hey, I'm there to eat not decorate. I loved the made-from-scratch speciality sauces that come with the (free) never-ending chips and salsa. Ask for the Creamy Jalape\u00f1o - a sauce so secretly delicious it's not even on the menu. Also try the Deluxe Tomatillo sauce made with sour cream, fresh herbs, cilantro and spices. Chuy's Frozen Peach Margarita ($6.95) is one of my favorite cocktails on the menu. Made with Exotico Silver tequila, triple sec, real peaches and fresh-squeezed lime juice, it's surprisingly refreshing for a margarita. Not too sweet and just a touch tart.From tacos to taquitos (and even margaritas) the Austin-based restaurant chain certainly proves that everything is bigger in Texas. Like the Green Chile Chicken Taquitos, a Chuy's Thursday special ($8.49) made with hand-rolled flour tortillas, shredded chicken and green chiles, rolled up and lightly fried - then topped with Creamy Jalape\u00f1o sauce and served with green chile rice and refried beans. It's a HUGE plate of food (especially for the price), but I didn't mind taking some home for later. The portions are certainly a bonus, but the taste really brings it home. Chuy's marinates their meat for 24 hours in a signature blend of Shiner Bock beer, serrano peppers, lime juice and spices. It's some of the most tender, deliciously marinated meat I've had at a Tex-Mex restaurant.Overall, I'm impressed."], ["Daniel K.", "You know for all the crap reviews of this place... It is what it is... Its on the Plaza... Its a chain... Its texmex... blah blah blah. \u00a0Its not bad! \u00a0Happy Hour is where its at. \u00a0The Nachos were awesome! large size nachos (about 10 of them) that you could just pick one up and it was yours... with everything you want on them. The salsa and guac were meh. But to be expected. \u00a0Just ask for lime and whatever else you need in there.Tasted the steak burrito... Not too shabby... Steak was seasoned well. \u00a0The tortillas were made in house. \u00a0Mine was a tad under done but still tasty. Tasted the Chicken enchiladas... \u00a0very good.

Very attentive and polite.

Their jalape\u00f1o ranch is to die for and you should ask for it alongside your chips. The atmosphere is super funky and unique. It's a hodgepodge of random decor.Both times I've been here for dinner on work trips, it's been relatively empty. That being said, I've always received great service. From this location I've ordered both Baja shrimp tacos and the deluxe chicken enchiladas. I also ordered a dinner salad - who does that right?

This Chuy's is snuggled right in the middle of Country Club Plaza, so it's easily accessible to anyone in the vicinity. The service was good for a quick lunch, and the food satisfying as well.

The salsa tastes really fresh and chips come out warm. I got southwestern enchiladas with an egg on top as part of a combo (very good deal with a relleno). My egg yolk was overcooked so I asked for a new egg, which they quickly brought and even comped my meal, which was unnecessarily nice of them.

A+"], ["Annie M.", "I am from Austin and SO happy that there is finally a Tex Mex (NOT the same as Mexican food) choice in KC that does not include Velveeta. \u00a0While this is a chain, it is a small chain and I am very proud of them for adding this location. \u00a0It is just as bit as good as the original back in Texas.My favorite is the Southwest Platter or sharing the Elvis Platter. \u00a0Their enchiladas are the bomb. \u00a0No other restaurant in KC can touch their homemade tortillas or salsa. \u00a0And thank you, thank for finally supplying KC with swirl margaritas! \u00a0For you gringos that means a mix of frozen lime and frozen flavor of choice-Mango, Raspberry, Strawberry etc.KC Chuy's has filled a void in my heart and I love them forever!"], ["Josel B.", "So...if you're a Mexican restaurant you better have Huevos Rancheros or else you won't be pleasing this little yelper. Chuy's may not have Huevos Rancheros on their menu, but they went out of their way and made it for me anyway! This, my friends, is the reason Chuy's has become one of my favorite Mexican joints to eat at.As an undiagnosed ADHD guy, I love how they decorated the place. It's like 54th Street Grill and Buca de Bepo, where they just stick a bunch of random things on the wall but make it work! The place was clean and service was great! That waitress really did go above and beyond and got the cook to give me what I wanted! For about $6 plus tax, my dish was a steal! I got a heaping amount of Mexican rice, refried beans, and two sunny side up eggs, just the way I like it. PLUS YOU CAN ADD MEAT! For me I added roasted chicken! (lol the only healthy part of it) For other dishes on the menu that had this amount of food, their prices were roughly $10-12 each, so I was definitely happy getting such a good deal! Pair it with their sauces, they were bomb! Forgot to ask what they were, but trust me add their sauces on top of your meal and you will be a happy customer!Thanks Chuy's! I will definitely be coming back here!Happy Eating!"], ["Carolyn H.", "So excited this place is expanding! We were visiting KC from Virginia and were happy to learn they're coming to our area.Decor is eclectic and bright. Hubcaps, old cameras, and lights were part of the atmosphere.Service was friendly and prompt. Ask for Tanner Scott, the manager: he knows everything about the company and is super helpful. He's been with the company 21 years!!Food was really good. Chile rellenos are the best I've ever had! The creamy jalape\u00f1o and the cilantro sauces (that you ask the server for with the chips and salsa) are delicious! Homemade tortillas (again, you have to ask) are soft and yummy.My Perfect Margarita was just ok; not well mixed or salted. But I guess frozen margaritas are more their forte. We're excited to come again closer to home!"], ["Lauren M.", "Sometimes I have low expectations for new plaza restaurants and also when Tex Mex is involved. I was pleasantly surprised at what Chuy's had to offer. Several Tex Mex inspired dishes, and I had the chicken flautas. Delicious and the flautas were smaller than normal and you got 5 of them. I liked that and the refried beans has a great flavor to them. They had really awesome Texas martinis and it's nice that they give you the shaker with liquor/ice so you can pour at your leisure. The service was really good and our server catered to us frequently and got our food out fast. Great place for families or large parties."], ["Matt E.", "Yeah, I just don't know that I can get behind Chuy's. I've visited a few times now, and while I will admit that the food is pretty tasty, the atmosphere is just too much. WAY too much. Every single inch of the space is covered in kitschy bric-a-brac and they're so obsessed with shoving fun down your throat that it left a bad taste in my mouth. Hubcaps cover the ceiling. Glass statues line the bar. The entryway is covered in old cameras. Hundreds of wooden fish hang from the ceiling. the walls are covered in pictures of chihuahuas. The staff all wear \"funny\" t-shirts with somewhat stale pop-culture references.I'm all for being organized, but with how overly-themed every corner of the restaurant is, you can tell that it's hyper corporate, and that's just not my cup of tea. This place was designed by committee, for sure.That being said, the food is pretty dang good. The chicken chimichanga was a-ok, but I really preferred my combo fajitas. They were an incredibly ample portion, and the chicken and steak were both perfectly cooked and seasoned. The tortillas are phenomenal, made fresh at a little station you pass as you walk in. A hefty portion of fixins come on the side (rice, beans, guac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce) that guarantee you'll be enjoying pretty awesome fajitas, indeed. The enchiladas were good, and the large appetizer portion of guacamole was fantastic! They make good food at Chuy's, and affordable to boot. The affordable thing is a double-edged sword, however. This place is a ball-pit away from being Chucky Cheese. OK, maybe not really, but the number of families and screaming kids has to be addressed. In concept, I'm all for family-friendly and affordable restaurants, but for me personally this is pretty intense. The bar was a madhouse of children, and the kids directly behind me in the dining room kept touching me. Annoying.Another positive is the service. Brandi was our waitress on our last visit and she's great. ZERO complaints. She really knows the menu, anticipates our needs (more chips, refills and so forth) and has a really magnetic personality. I bet she makes a killing. Her co-workers were all great as well, this place excels at teamwork. The staff is always buzzing around the floor, making sure people are well taken care of. So, if the things I identified as negatives aren't negatives to you personally, I say get to Chuy's ASAP. For me, the place is just alright. If people wanted to go, I'd be glad to accompany with little-to-no hesitation. But I don't think I'll be seeking it out, especially considering how many fantastic (and significantly more laid back) Mexican restaurants there are in KC."], ["Whitney J.", "Let me tell you something about Chuy's though.... The food is FIRE!! LOL! No but for real, I love it. You must get the prickly pear margarita, no lie, so good!!! I had the Baja shrimp tacos with beans and rice on the side and ohhh man, I was so stuffed and so satisfied. Everything was delicious, only down side, wish they had endless chips like Los Tules, but besides that it was a wonderful dinner and will most definitely be back again!"], ["Nathan W.", "Love this place!

The staff are super friendly, fast service, and the food is amazing!!"], ["Sara B.", "This is a very good Mexican/ tex-Mex place to eat. The chile rllenos are very delicious. The meals are a tad pricey for one individual, look to pay between 8 and 9 bucks per meal, however, it is reasonable at the same time if you are looking to share with a small child, which is what me and my husband do with our two kids and we always wind up all being full as ticks at the end. I love that they offer a variety of sauce options free of charge to go with your table chips. You can get one sauce or a variety. My husband's only grievance is that when he orders something and asks for no sour cream (he hates the stuff), he really has to stress the no sour cream part or he might still wind up with sour cream on his food. I love that it is right across from the park at The Plaza with the big beautiful fountain that you can see from the retaurants huge windows. I also love the atmosphere at Chuy's the interior is very well decorated with all kinds of southwest/artsy stuff. They staff is also very friendly and helpful."], ["Susan S.", "I've made plenty of trips to Austin over the years, so it was curious that I had never eaten at Chuy's. I'm glad we now have the opportunity in KC, though. It's kitchy and fun and a good time.Our waitress was great - she navigated us through the menu, was prompt in her service, and, when she overheard me making a comment about the blackberry frozen margarita, brought us samples. The place had not been open very long when I went, and she was noticeably knowledgeable about everything.While the servings are large enough that you probably don't need additional food, the nacho bar was still worth a visit.I had the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, which, ridiculous name aside, was very tasty. Everyone in my party liked their food and was anxious to return."], ["Lauren P.", "Oh Chuy's, how I've missed you. I'm originally from Austin, Texas so this joint is all too familiar and beloved in my household. Therefore I can't even begin to tell you how glorious it was to hear they would be opening one here this past year. After trying the Kansas City Star's \"Best Mexican in Kansas City\" picks a couple of years ago, I was sorely lacking some good Mexican food (sorry Ponak's, it just didn't work out!) Now I have to say...this particular location leaves a little to be desired. I've gone a few times now for happy hour and while the drinks and food were great, the service leaves a bit to be desired. Our waitress had trouble getting our order correct, and then stood there mean-mugging us after we finished our meals and continued to drink for another hour or so. Unfortunately for her, the only thing dying from her death stare was the little bit of tip she still had left after our food debacle.That being said I personally think the food here is miles above other joints in the city, and the margaritas are TO DIE FOR. This is the perfect place to go for happy hour (free chips, queso, salsa, jalapeno ranch *waggles eyebrows*) and as long as you get there fairly early you shouldn't have to wait very long. Overall I will continue to give this place my undying loyalty considering it is the same great Tex Mex I've lived off of my entire life...however I'm hoping future visits will result in better service."], ["Ern C.", "first time to a Chuy's since 1993 in Austin. \u00a0Still as yummy as I recall. \u00a0Great service, yummy food."], ["Joshua B.", "I took 3 new people (first timers) to Chuy's tonight, at 9:15 pm. \u00a0As usual, the experience was awesome. \u00a0We had a different server, but she was just as amazing as the other two were. \u00a0Very attentive and seemed anxious to get whatever we wanted, without hesitation. \u00a0One person in our party had weight-loss surgery, and they had the perfect small-portioned meal to suit her needs and desires."], ["Mel P.", "Chuys has decent Mexican food. Not great, but not terrible either. I prefer tex mex (like my beloved Carlos O Kellys) and finding a great tex mex restaurant in KC is apparently impossible. That being said, a restaurant with average food can really save business by having amazing service- and that's been my experience at Chuys. Last night I ate there and had a server named Steven. He was prompt and polite, we never ran out of chips & salsa or water, and our food came out in just minutes. When we first arrived we were also told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, but only waited like 5 minutes. Crazy good customer service, especially for a Saturday night."], ["Logan N.", "My mom loves this place so i took her there for lunch. \u00a0I didn't have really high expectations because I don't like most of the Mexican restaurant's she does. \u00a0I ordered cheese dip and a chicken fajita burrito. \u00a0Both were amazing. \u00a0I would have given 5 stars but i hate going to the plaza and trying to park. \u00a0The food is excellent though."], ["Missy B.", "Rating 4/5 because we went on a beautiful day when we could sit outside. The food was 3.5/5. Mom told me to let everyone know you get a great portion for the prices, so I can't leave that out. She rates the ground sirloin tacos (comes with 3) above average. I enjoyed the baja grilled shrimp tacos (2), but they lacked cream sauce. We both added the chile con queso to our entrees which made them tastier. Also, the soft tortillas were quite puffy, but I actually liked the thickness. No low card there! Refills are not free. My two diet cokes cost $5.18. The staff was friendly and our waiter was attentive, but it was not busy. Also, I was not asked if I wanted a refill; it was just given... at a hefty price! The chips are very thin and crispy and so good with the spicy pico de gallo salsa! We didn't ask if they had a more \"salsa consistency\" salsa, which we typically prefer, yet we loved the chunky stuff this time."], ["Crystal W.", "Chuy's is like a quintessential 1950\u2032s diner on Mexican acid. Seriously - eating at this place is a real trip.Hundreds of \u00a0old-fashioned cameras are glued to the walls of the entryway. Inside, every area of the expansive dining area has a theme. There's a palm tree room. There's a hot rod room, ceiling covered in hubcaps. The bar's theme is chihuahuas. Pictures of them - and framed photographs of staff dogs - hang all over the walls. It's the next best thing to being able to bring your dog inside, I guess. Really, there is so much to take in visually at Chuy's that I didn't have high expectations for the food. But everything was honestly delicious.We tasted a whole platter of different homemade salsas. Surprisingly, even the pico de gallo that comes standard with every bowl of homemade chips had serious heat. The \"Perfect Margarita\" and Texas Martini were both made strong enough that one was plenty.The chile relleno was among the best I've ever eaten. The breading was crispy, the pepper was spicy and the cheese wasn't greasy. And the veggie enchilada was filled with actual vegetables, like squash and red pepper.If you go to Chuy's, there's no way you will have room for dessert.

She checked in with me shortly after my food was delivered, but then I was left on my own. During the meal she walked by my table three times before I finally stopped her to ask for a refill, even after I had moved my empty glass to the edge of the table to make sure she could see it.

I loved the grilled chicken in the taco. The fixin's were not thrilling. For some reason they put lettuce on the chicken and then the pico, cheese and guac are on the place. After I removed the lettuce and added the fixin's. Good tacos. The rice and beans are not necessary.One thing I found is that I prefer the creamy jalape\u00f1o sauce over their chip salsa that they bring to the table. Surprise!! I like the tasty fattening dip.

We were impressed by the friendliness of our hostess and other servers. The patio view of the fountain made for a relaxing ambiance. Service was prompt and professional. Our waitress, Frann, could not have been more attentive. She was a fabulous server and made the experience all the better, and her recommendation of the Mexican Martini was spot on. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that free queso, ground beef and refried beans were included in happy hour. We ate enough to call it dinner. What to order? Start with a house margarita on the rocks, with salt. My favorite items on the menu are the Chile Rellenos and the Chica Chica Boom Boom chicken enchiladas. In fact, I'd recommend requesting a side of boom boom sauce no matter what you are ordering. It's hot cheese sauce, spicier than queso. My husband always gets the Chuychanga, he always will, and he is never disappointed.The bottom line is that if you want the best Tex Mex in Kansas City, do like the Texans do and go to Chuy's!

Don't knock it until you try it.The sides I picked were standard beans and rice. Both had more flavor than the average Amerimex place. I really like this stop on top of Summit."], ["Collin P.", "Really delightful. I had the three taco plate and it was some of the best Mexican food I've tasted. The staff are really friendly and informative. Will definitely be going back!"], ["Dave P.", "I've been here twice for lunch, and it's absolutely amazing. Truly feels like you're in abuela's kitchen. Very friendly, knowledgeable staff - there's no menu, but everyone is happy to help, explain what each dish is, and make sure you're satisfied. At under 10 bucks, can't be beat!"], ["James D.", "What a fiesta! I was a little leary of the outside appearance of the building but sucked it up and went inside anyways. A big cloud of smoke and haze greets you as you enter. And you might want to leave your clothes in your car or you will smell like an el taco (spanish for taco) the rest of the day.You order right at the kitchen, you can watch them cook and see everything that happens behind the scenes. All of the staff was super friendly and easy to understand which is always a plus. This place is SUPER authentic, this is were you go to get the real home cooked Mexican food. I got a fajita skillet and it was mighty tasty, served on a cattle branding hot skillet. The meat was delish and it wasn't lathered in oil like a lot of places to. After the meal I didn't feel like my arteries were clogged so +1.There is a buffet on Fridays that I am going to hit up, even though I was craving tacos when I went in I got the special, so I have to go back to try the tacos.If only I had time in my lunch break to take a siesta after eating..."], ["Lindsay B.", "I finally tried this place today. Don't let the less than desirable interior fool you. The food is FABULOUS, authentic and great value. The employees treat you like family. Def a must for KC locals."], ["Scott T.", "Must... return... soon.So many great choices... only so much room on the plate and the stomach, but for starters how about the huge helpings of spicy pork, chicharrones, the killer tacos and a great side of rice and beans. None of that too much melted cheese crap you get at the faux Mexican joints. And how about impossibly too many fresh corn or flour tortillas to soak up what remains on the plate (little, on mine). Terrific authentic Mexican flavors served up in a real joint with a bit of good attitude and humor from the server. Oh, and you have to like a girl carving up a carcass nearby, apparently in preparation for a future meal. Like, like, like. Must return soon with a very empty stomach. Lots of great Mexican choices in this general area of town but this is one to not be missed."], ["Melissa S.", "Get the tamales. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0You will never regret it. \u00a0They will make special order ones, too. \u00a0Oh my! \u00a0They are all great! And super friendly. \u00a0We love this place."], ["Shawn M.", "The food here is awesome!! While traveling in Kansas City I was craving huevos rancheros and yelped this place. \u00a0The reviews were fantastic so I had to try it. \u00a0The green chile was fabulous. The refried beans were some of the best I've ever tasted and the tamales were so good I brought some back with me to Seattle!! When I find myself in Kansas City again I am definitely coming back here..."], ["Ellen S.", "I adore Los Alamos for three reasons:1. Food: so, so, so, so yummy. But, don't go if you're a vegetarian. I've tried to get something different every time, and have yet to be disappointed. And, if you really aren't sure what you want, just ask for a plate with a little bit of everything. Your mouth will be so happy!2. The location: The Westside/17th & Summit area is a fun hidden gem if you want authentic KC without the crowds of the Plaza or First Fridays. When you're done here, visit Little Freshie for a snow cone, Chez Elle for a dessert crepe, or Westside Local for a drink. A very enthusiastic 3: THE STAFF. They're welcoming and helpful when you order, and always eager to help even though for the most part your experience is self-serve. If Agustin, the owner, is around and sees your drink is low, there's a good chance he'll offer to fill it for you. Plus, as an added bonus, I've taken my Spanish Language Meetup group here for an immersion experience, and the staff were awesome and patient while us gringos muttered our orders in broken Spanish. Plus they didn't revert to English once we explained the idea.It's been fun watching this establishment grow over the past few years, too. When we first went it was mostly grocery store with a few tables tucked in where they fit. They've since cut the grocery side down by about half and have a proper dining area now.TL;DR - Great food, staff; fun location & ambiance. (Unless you're a vegetarian.)"], ["Darren M.", "The best, most authentic Mexican food in the city.I really don't know how else to describe it. My wife is from Mexico, and I've spent several months living there myself. I've never found anything in the city that compares.We were there this last Saturday, and both had the chilaquiles. We both agreed they were the best we've ever eaten, period."]], "Z\u00f3calo Mexican Cuisine & Tequileria": []}
