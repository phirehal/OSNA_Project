In the beginning there were in fact two younger gentlemen that appeared to be designing the food and decor; & the whole experience was great! The last two times I have dined there, it appears that these two young men no longer work there; and, the food has suffered quite a bit!

I can't actually tell you about that because after inviting friends to lunch here today there was such a variety of awful smells that we actually had to leave because my stomach was hurting from it. We all had different opinions on whether it was the bathrooms, blanched veggies or two day old fish, but it was safe to say, at least in the area where we were sat, it was a deal breaker. I hesitated to bring this to light here, as maybe there was just a bathroom issue and it was a one off, but I was pretty disgusted and I hope they can fix the issue. I'll try again -- without any friends who I've promised a great experience."], ["Maura C.", "I haven't ever been in here because every time I have driven by it looks empty. Come to figure out you can't see the dining room from the front! It was very good! So glad we tried it. They have GaPow on the menu which was my favorite dish while visiting Bangkok last year. It was delicious and very much like the dish I had in Thailand! Spring rolls were wonderful as well. Our waitress was super sweet and we talked about my recent trip and she was just lovely. Only complaint was the funky smell - everything looked clean but they need a Plummer or someone in there to figure that out! I'll be back for phad Thai soon!"], ["M L.", "Everything was delicious and the service was wonderful. We had the Phuket rolls, crab rangoons, and pad thai -- we left with happy tummies! Thank you, Lemongrass!"], ["Christina M.", "We ordered delivery via GrubHub and it was delicious! The Udon noodle soup and green papaya salad were wonderful. We would definitely try their food again. The tempura was a little greasy, but this is probably because it was delivered instead of eaten in-house.

He disappeared for a while before returning to take our order. It was definitely an eclectic menu and we enjoyed everything we ordered, especially the spring rolls. The dish I ordered, the pad khee mow, was my favorite and as good as I've had elsewhere. The seafood combo and curry we ordered were also very good.I look forward to returning to try more on the menu."], ["Trista C.", "Great food, cool ambience, nice staff. The dining room is well decorated. We dined on a weekday, so it was not crowded. There were flat screen tvs showing images of Thailand.

The people in the tables near us were also complaining about the hotness of the mild dishes and were having a hard time eating them."], ["Heather W.", "Oh my YUM!

I've eaten at the best places in Thai Town in Los Angeles where every billboard is in Thai. I've eaten at the best Thai places in Kansas City. I have to say that this place is hands-down the best in Kansas City. My only complaint is that the menu doesn't have more items. But, I would rather have excellent quality than excellent quantity any day of the week.The waiters had a little extra time to talk to me tonight because it was slow due to the weather, but they explained a few things about why it's better. For example, real tamarind instead of vinegar in the phad Thai. I usually don't even care too much for phad Thai... but it was worth trying here. Also, importantly, they don't use the same coconut milk that most Thai restaurants do... They use coconuts and turn it into the coconut milk there themselves, and fresh. It makes all the difference in the world. I mean, ALL the difference in the world.Plus, there is never an objectionable cut of meat here. You can tell that they paid attention to every detail, including not using cuts of meat that might have a little extra fat here and there. Particularly the gristly kind that we all run into from time to time at restaurants. You can tell that these guys really care, really want the business, and really want to succeed... And it's all right there in the plate. Right where I like it. If it's important to you, the atmosphere is also nice. I'm not much of an atmosphere guy... I like to focus on the food and the value for the money there. But, the atmosphere is plenty good.In the process of chatting me up about all the particulars, the waiter decided to bring me a free Thai iced tea. And, it's going to sound stupid, but even it was better than any other Thai iced tea in town. Seriously. I could tell that it was brewed nice and strong, and that the creamy milk on top was plenty fresh. I can't wait to go back again. I suggest you get down there asap. I don't think you will believe just how good it is. It is truly a cut above. \u00a0Beyond beyond."], ["Cornelia H.", "Delicious food! Excellent service!

The service was great, the food was excellent, and the ambiance was pleasant. We'd give this place 4.5 stars. Appetizers: We ordered the Spring Roll Deluxe appetizer and both the soft spring rolls and the Thai egg rolls were a hit. Great flavors and super simple. \u00a0My husband ordered the Galangal soup and the broth was delicious. \u00a0We also enjoyed the chicken satay. For our main entrees: I ordered the Spicy Thai cashew. Garlicy. Spicy but not too much. All these flavors melded together into the perfect blend of spicy sweet with a touch of heat. Yellow curry, beef - curry sauce creamy, sweet, and savory. The beef was a tad overcooked.  Phase Sea Eaw, shrimp - delicious, good shrimp, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. (My 8yo)Overall, this was a great place and if we lived in this area we would most definitely come back."], ["Reed N.", "Pretty and tasty Thai cuisine.The soup I had was rich and delicious. Galangal soup.. love galanga root flavor, red chili paste, coconut, fish sauce, and a touch of sugar. So good.Service was excellent."], ["Steven C.", "We were here two years ago and I would have said it was O K for eastern Jackson County Thai food, which is damnation by faint praise. Tonight was a different story. I had green curry chicken and it was great. On the brink of too sweet, but balanced out with the perfect degree of heat. My wife had the eggplant curry with beef. Also excellent. \u00a0I tried some. Spring rolls were heavy on the lettuce, but this seems to be what you get everywhere these days. It's called cheaping out. Portions are not as big as in some places, but most restaurants give you too much. \u00a0These dishes are reasonable for the price, which is about $10 for a curry dish if you don't get shrimp or seafood. \u00a0So now this place is good enough for western Jackson County or possibly even Johnson County."], ["Justin E.", "One of my favorite Thai food places. Yes my favorite thai is located in Blue Springs MO...Nothing on the menu is bad. I can order with my eyes closed and know I'm getting something amazing. The servers and owner remember us and give us that familiar hello good to see you when we walk in. My only grip is since they moved (used to be Bau Thai) they've stream lined their menu and took off some of our choice entrees. That's ok, I'm just happy they didn't go out of business!"], ["Cassie L.", "While the food is good, portions can be very small for the price. \u00a0Service is also inconsistent. \u00a0Went the other evening and there were two wait staff. \u00a0Took 1.5 hours to get our food. \u00a0Kept having to ask for drink refills. \u00a0No apologies or anything..."], ["Katherine A.", "YUM! Great food! Fresh, not greasy, kind of sweeter sauces. Broccoli Beef was great! Very fast service, and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this place, as it was just off the highway in a newer strip mall. Just behind the Taco Bueno."], ["Kaylin T.", "The portion size is horrible. My husband, kids and I stopped by after work at 8:40pm. They close at 9pm, so we felt bad and didn't want to make them stay late waiting on us to eat. Instead we ordered to go. We should have checked the to go box for the amount of food. We bought two entrees and soup to go. We discovered when we got home, the amount of food they have given us only covered my husband or myself eating. Each entree box was 1/3 full and the soup had more liquid and about 10 pieces of food. For $36 of food to feed one person definitely does not make it worth the stop. I had to go ahead and make more food at home to feed the kids and myself. No point in stopping at this restaurant to eat to avoid cooking, if I had to cook anyway and so late into the evening. Next time, I'll drive a little further towards Kansas City for Tasty Thai or Thai Place...."], ["Marie B.", "I am not an expert on Thai food, however I won't be looking any further on trying new Thai places. I had the Vegetable Red Curry which had eggplant, green beans, broccoli, napa (I think) cabbage, and other yummy vegetables that I can't remember right now :) I ordered a Thai Iced Tea which was a little sweet for my liking, but I still drank the entire thing. I will be getting two meals out of my curry dish which came with a side of Jasmine rice. My dish was about $11 which at first I thought was a bit much but THEN when I inquired about my dish and if I could get the cabbage at any local grocery store (with the intention on trying to make this masterpiece in my own kitchen), she told me they buy their stuff from the City Market!! So the price is well worth it. I love supporting local restaurants, especially when they are also supporting local."], ["Melinda H.", "I really wanted to like this place, but sadly did not. We started off with fried spring rolls & they were greasy & not a lot of flavor. For my meal I had their galangal soup which I asked if it was like Tom Khai Gai & she said yes....it was not. I ordered the large bowl & it was the smallest \"large\" bowl I've ever ordered. It was also very sweet & really the only flavor was coconut milk. My daughter had the Pad Thai & it was bland. My son had the Thai Noodle Soup & it was salty & bland also. My husband had Panaang Curry & it was very small & not a lot of vegetables. I also think the portion sizes are very small for the price considering what you get at other Thai places in the area. We love Thai, but this just really missed the long-boat. ;)"], ["Jack W.", "Ate here for the first time tonight. It's a billion times better than the old Thai place that used to be across the street. Very nice inside which I didn't expect for Blue Springs. We had 3 types of rolls including the spring rolls (ok) and the cream cheese roll (to die for!). I've never been a big Tai fan as I'm not a big veggie or curry person but this place was impressive. We had the Red Curry and Pad Thai both of which the plates got licked clean. I was even contemplating bringing some home for tomorrow it was that good. I highly recommend this place. A little pricey for what I want to spend when I eat out but for how good it was and the location - I'll for sure be back!!!"], ["Jordan B.", "Hands down the best thai food I have ever had.I have been going here with my family for over a decade. They know our order right when we walk in the door--All you need: The Three Kings, Panang Curry Chicken, Pad Thai Chicken & Shrimp, Fried Rice.It's amazing and never busy. MUST TRY."], ["Kati M.", "This is one of our favorite restaurants in town. My boyfriend and I always start with the crab rangoon! I love them because they aren't super thick like some places. They're just crunchy enough with the perfect amount of filling and a delicious dipping sauce. We split the Pad Thai which is a generous portion. He gets a side of fried rice which he loves and I get the Galangal soup. It's SO amazing! I give the food 5 stars but the service is not always up to par. There is one waitress that always seems to have a bad attitude and we've had her a couple of times. We even went on a slow night and had to wait 10 minutes before she even took our drink order.

Nice soft jazz style music in background. Cloth napkins, vinyl tablecloths. \u00a0 Ordered the Galangal soup, a coconut based soup with mushrooms and your choice of meat. I chose shrimp and was happy with the presentation and warm mellow flavors. Not too much coconut flavor, but just enough to complement the other ingredients. \u00a0The cup size satisfied for appetizer. I moved on to vegetable yellow curry. It came served in a bowl with a generous variety of vegetables, not loaded with potatoes like other Thai restaurants. \u00a0You can tell that care was taken to prepare the meal.

The first time we sat down for a late lunch. Our server assured us that the Chicken Pho was better than any Vietnamese variety. I had my doubts but we tried it anyway.It was as good as promised! The Pad Thai was quite good as well. I got it one notch below \"Thai hot\" which was perfect for me.This time we got carryout for lunch. I have to mention the care they took in packaging. The Pho broth & chicken was in a tightly sealed plastic container and then wrapped in plastic wrap. They included a clam shell with sprouts, rice noodles, fresh basil, & sliced onions.My dish, the Tamarind Chicken, was in the usual clam shell that they lined with aluminum foil. A very nice touch to me.The Pho was it's usual state of perfection. This was my first taste of Tamarind Chicken. I think it may be my favorite dish, even better than the Pad Thai. Unless you're familiar with tamarind, I don't know how to describe it. The tamarind flavor is present in every bite but not over powering. It was served with steamed rice & steamed veggies. An absolutely wonderful dish. I can't forget to mention the staff. They were attentive & informative without being over bearing. When I went for carryout, I was served a glass of ice water & a bowl of hot & sour soup while I waited."], ["Anshul C.", "Tonight was my first time at Thai Spice and it is now officially my favorite Thai food in Kansas City. The menu is expansive and EVERYTHING sounds amazing. My group of four ordered the crab rangoon, red curry, black soy sauce noodles, yellow curry, and Thai spice fried rice. Everything was delicious. The crab rangoon had very thin wrappers and made for a lighter appetizer. Each entree was huge and allowed us to have enough to have some lunch for tomorrow.

The chicken and beef (what little was in it) was dry and overcooked. \u00a0The 2 pieces of shrimp that were in it were so hard and rubbery you could play miniature handball with them. \u00a0The crab fried rice smelled bad, like bad fish. \u00a0No, it's not imitation crab, but it's not very fresh crab either.The sesame chicken was the best dish. \u00a0Very flavorful sauce. \u00a0But again, the chicken was dry and overcooked.I was definitely looking forward to having a Thai place in Independence. \u00a0But at these prices and mediocre food I'll stick with my regular Chinese joint on 24 Hwy."], ["Michael H.", "So, I've been here a few times and HIGHLY recommend it! The ingredients are fresh, the food is excellent and very authentic. The service is fast, but not always perfect. Though if they make a mistake, it is corrected very quickly! And the food is always served steaming hot! The restaurant and bathrooms are very clean and the walls are simply decorated with food porn to make your mouth water like a cartoon character from the moment you walk in. Also the prices are right on for those of us on a budget. With HUGE dinner portions and lunch entrees that come with soup and the appetizer of the day, you will NOT leave hungry. I've been to both locations a few times and they've been consistant on every visit. I've also tried about half the menu, which is impressive considering how many options there are. Hard to pick a fave! But if I had to choose one it would be the very craveable Drunken Noodles with chicken. Slightly sweet, house made chili paste sauce, but balanced so you can taste the basil, ginger, garlic, etc.. They also offer a few different fried rice dishes, like crab fried rice (YES CRAB, Weeeeeeeee) and Pineapple fried rice (normal fried rice ingredients plus pineapple, chicken, shrimp, cashews, raisins). The Garlic Pork and Ginger Delight w/ chicken and lots of veggies are also faves! And don't get me talking about the curry's or I'll never stfu!Like the walls, the menu has lots of tantalizzing pictures to help you choose the right dish. And of course you can choose 4 levels of heat to suit your palate. Thai HOT for me, but I suggest a Thai tea to help keep the burning in check! The soups and appetizers are all done very well. Pretty much everything I've eaten there just makes you want more from first to last bite! Even the freaking steamed white rice served with some dishes is excellent, perfectly cooked and floral! And many menu options allow you to choose chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, all veggies or tofu. That makes it hipster friendly, right?Anyways, I am usually planning my next meal there while paying the bill, haha! Yep, it's that good, people! SO let's review, fresh, fast & very friendly service, hot food, great price and BIG portions! Why are you still reading this review, JUST GO THERE! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!

Very rich and flavorful.General Tso's Chicken (Thai Style) - Quite good, but not great. Lightly (very lightly) breaded and stir fried, it was sweet and cake with broccoli. A basic dish that is probably not for the adventurous, but tasty nonetheless. Bubble Tea - Pretty awful. I had lychee, and my fiance had mango. The taste of the fruit was fine, but the bubbles were awful. No flavor, rock hard. At $3.50 a pop, it was a waste of money. Rice - good, sticky, and plentiful.All in all, our bill was $42 with tax, or $12 after the Groupon, which I feel was fair (aside from the Bubble Tea). The restaurant itself is clean but basic.

The vegetables in the Pad Thai Jay were just the opposite of the noodles and way undercooked. Again the flavor seemed to be there but it was like eating mush (noodles) with rocks (vegetables). The Thai Tea Bubble Tea was another bad idea. The boba was older than me and the drink lacked actual tea flavor. I think it was from a pre made mix because they said that they could not adjust the sweetness. All of the good reviews here seem to be about the buffet. So, I might have gotten the wrong things. I MAY? go back and try the buffet in the future."], ["Marie F.", "2.5 starsThai buffet - sounds like heaven on a hot plate. \u00a0We were not imprressed, however. \u00a0The food was bland. \u00a0I guess they do this because people like different levels of heat.

The menu has a good variety and the ingredients are fresh and plentiful."], ["Shane W.", "Ok, it's time to write this review. I was a big fan of the Gladstone location and stopped by whenever I could. I even made special trips there just for Longboards; from my office in the Crossroads, or home near Liberty. It was always worth the trip. So, when I learned another was opening closer to my home, it was a really big deal. A lot of restaurants have opened in Liberty in the last several years, many of them have ceded way to some other restaurant and many others are just your typical franchised copy of something you've seen dozens of times before and run by people who just want you in and out as quickly as possible.But that's not what Longboards is at all. A) It's locally owned and B) They have a way of doing business. It's not stenciled on the door or printed in advertising but it's there and they take it very seriously. I don't know what you call it, Oha, Huna, Aloha Spirit, it probably doesn't really need a name because they're not there to tell you about it. It means, love, friendship, joy, kindness, respect and probably a few others that this world could use some more of.Opening day, I hear my friends raving about it, stories are going around about lines out the door - I had to work but I couldn't wait to have dinner there. Their wraps are amazing really.I ordered my normal vegan version of the Wow Kung Pow: rice, snow peas, peanuts, and smoked tofu with an amazing spicy sauce that I've been trying to reproduce at home for a year. All wrapped in a wheat tortilla and grilled like a panini. The Wow Kung Pow on the menu has chicken instead of tofu and has cheese.So after painstakingly avoiding animal-based food for six years, I'd eaten about a third of it when I realized it had chicken in it. I know it's hard to understand if you're a meat-eater but to say I was devastated really isn't an exaggeration. I love Longboards' philosophy of kindness and respect but in the moment that I stood up to take that wrap to the counter, I forgot it. I totally and unequivocally turned into a kind of jackass they have carefully crafted a kind of place to avoid. I laid my tray on the counter and told them I had been a vegetarian for six years and they just (effing) fed me chicken. I know, I'm not proud. I'm really embarrassed even and that's why I never wrote a review. I don't personally know the owners, many of my friends do so I know it's a family restaurant; owned by cousins, I believe. One of the owners followed me to my seat and calmly asked me not to use that language. He apologized and offered me a refund but was really clear about how they operate - they just don't want that energy around. I was lucky he didn't throw me out, he could have, and maybe should have. I don't know if they understand how I felt about eating chicken for the first time in six years, it was awful, it really was. I know most people wouldn't get it but in thinking about it now, I was as awful to them as eating that chicken was to me. The looks on their faces when I treated them that way wasn't anger, they were hurt. I know they felt terrible. For that, I am deeply sorry. They made an easy mistake that just happened to have pretty big consequences to one person. So, that was months ago. Today, I have what is probably a pretty comfortable lead as the Duke. Most weeks I take my son (omnivore) and daughter (vegetarian) and we all have our regulars. The great people who work there know us and I really don't think they remember the guy there every week is the guy that lost his shit on opening day. This review may remind them but I don't think they'll hold it against me - they just aren't those kind of people.You know what made me write this? I was there last week, ordered my usual, as did my kids and on the way out the door, one of them said, \"good night, it was good to see you\". I believe them, they meant it."], ["Connie G.", "We tried for the first time! \u00a0I had seen it many times on the urbanspoon app, but never tried it. The carne asada steak bowl was great!

Ordered take out last Sunday. It was awesome. I ordered the Panang curry and veggie spring rolls. I ordered the curry, because it is always a good indicator of how good the restaurant is.

Along with the soup, we ordered the Thai Chicken Noodle salad and the Ginger Stir Fry with Shrimp (our server's suggestion). The noodles in the salad were overcooked and kind of gummy and the rest of the ingredients were a bit bland. The Ginger Stir Fry just didn't have a lot of flavor to it either. We also ordered a side of Veggie Fried Rice for our kids (who wouldn't touch it) and that was probably the best entree we ordered!I'd be willing to try it again, maybe for lunch, but I don't think my husband would rush back with me."], ["Michael P.", "Another great option for Thai food around the OPKS area. Sawasdee serves up the Thai favorites you'd expect and some unusual specialties too. I found this place thanks to a Groupon and found myself returning even without the discounted to-go voucher. In each of my Thai food reviews I try to make a \"curry to curry\" comparison. Sawasdee doesn't disappoint. Our multiple trips here, I have sampled their panang, yellow, green, and red curries. None of these are too much different than other Thai restaurants, but they bring a great flavor and \"zing\" that not all other joints offer. At 11 bucks for chicken or beef, the price point is similar for similar amounts of food. One drawback here - we ordered curry to-go on three occasions here and were served three different amounts in the same plastic container. I would guess we had two - three fewer ounces the second time vs the first, and one ounce less on the third visit. I like the price point and the amount of food you receive provided it's a similar amount each time. You wouldn't want a 16 beer with only 13 ounces inside, right? We will definitely be back to Sawasdee in the future. It stacks up well against similar Thai places around the area. It's definitely in my top three Thai places around along with Sweet Siam and Pad Thai."], ["Grant H.", "I usually get takeout from here, but stopped in for lunch.

The former tenant of this location (whose name I forget) was the best, and we were truly sad to see it go. This replacement is almost as good. We went on a quiet weekday evening and it was pretty much dead. Service throughout wasn't great. Our waters were refilled, but nothing was done with a smile. Our server seemed miserable being there. Always a bummer, but the food is more important. We started with a papaya salad, hot - and it was HOT. It's always hot, of course, but this had me in tears and my wife practically unable to eat it. If you like hot food, like I do, it's a winner. It was even better two days later after sitting in my fridge, fermenting in its own spiciness. We also got a yellow curry rice with chicken, which was very delicious. Finally, we both love massaman curry, so we got an order of that (with beef, of course) - very, very good. Excellent flavor, quite close to what we've had in the muslim areas of Thailand. All of this, with water, was around $30 with tax but not tip.So, would we go back? Absolutely! Food was great.

My son ordered the deep fried whole Snapper which was also tasty , but if you're not experience with eating fish from the bone, stick to the Tilapia. I had Mongolian Beef, which was good but nothing special. It was ok, but a little pricey... I may return, but not any time soon."], ["Gina M.", "We LOVE Red Snapper! We typically start with the chicken satay, which is served with very tasty doing sauces! The teriyaki salmon is delicious, as is the basil seafood combo, but my favorite dish had probably been the Thai coconut red curry (I added shrimp). My fiance always orders the san Shan jam bong, which is very good, and obviously his favorite. The wait staff is always friendly, and the ambiance is good. One of our favorite places to eat!"], ["Alice H.", "Have come here for years since they opened and my dad has eaten at the owner's previous restaurant. Food was on point when they first opened when the owner cooks but these days that can be a rarity. I do love the choices and variety and overall the quality is still pretty good. Salmon rangoon is something you should always order. It's the best! My preference for the dishes varies each visit so I don't have a favorite. I personally don't love it as leftovers the next day because the sauces congeal and it kinda weirds me out but a lot of Chinese food have that after effect I guess? It doesn't stop me from getting it as take out to eat the same day or stopping in to eat in the restaurant."], ["Erica P.", "The Red Snapper is absolutely divine. My husband and I went and started the meal with one order of the Smoked Salmon Rangoon. Yeah I'm ashamed to say we ended up ordering 2 more orders of the Rangoon. It is one of the best I've had. I loved the salmon twist from the regular crab. I had a shrimp entree which I can't remember the correct name and my husband had General Tso Chicken. We had SOOOOO much food. No way we could finish all of our food, took doggie bags home. Our waiter was super friendly and patient with our indecisiveness. \u00a0Meal was a little pricey, but for the amount of food you get it is priced perfectly. We will add this place as a fav to visit for sure!"], ["Bill B.", "Americanized Chinese food at its best. \u00a0And hey, yes, I am American, and sometimes I'm in the mood for Americanized Chinese food. \u00a0On those days, Red Snapper will be high on my list. \u00a0If you have been to any of the best (and most expensive) Chinese restaurants in Beijing or Hong Kong (as I have), don't expect the same here --- not even close. \u00a0But of course you can expect a much lower bill here too.Also at Red Snapper, if you are a vegetarian, you won't have to explain that chicken stock and pork are not vegetarian, as you'll have to do in Hong Kong or China (unless you claim to be a Buddhist monk)."], ["Marisa B.", "I love this place. \u00a0It seems to be a great standby for any occasion. \u00a0We have done Mother Day, Christmas day, birthdays, family in town, week night random carry out, casual date night, etc. \u00a0It just seems to work for whatever the occasion. \u00a0The staff is attentive & accommodating, & the food is consistently good.The portion sizes are more than enough. \u00a0I always take home leftovers, & am thrilled to be able to do that.The thing that makes me the most happy as someone with dietary restrictions, is that I can trust Red Snapper to make whatever dish I am in the mood for suit my gluten free requirements. If you want your dish more spicy, this can be arranged. \u00a0If you are not sure about \"Pan Asian\" & want to play it safe, you most likely can find something more generic (a traditional Chinese rice type dish perhaps).I always hear that both the crab rangoon and the calamari are AMAZING here. I would not know this from experience (due to shell allergy). \u00a0But everyone I have ever eaten with who has ordered either of those items has raved about them.The signature dish the \"red snapper\" also seems to get a lot of praise. \u00a0I tend to go with rice noodle dishes. \u00a0The Pad Thai for example (which is quite tasty). \u00a0They even have a small bar, with happy hour specials, a variety of teas, & some desserts if you are craving something sweet.We have never had a problem getting in. \u00a0The space is super clean, (bathrooms are pretty cool), & our service has always been exceptional."], ["Marie F.", "My friend was feeling a little under the weather and I felt that soup and hot tea would be conducive to his healing. \u00a0I had picked up a menu when I was at the Quizno's near them last week, \u00a0so I knew these guys had what we needed.We ordered the Udon and the San Shan Jam Bong soup. \u00a0Having heard such good things about the Smoked Salmon Rangoon we ordered them as an appetizer. \u00a0The rangoons were served with a sweet mango sauce and a spicier (perhaps wasabi based) sauce. \u00a0They didn't taste any different than a crab rangoon. \u00a0I happen to like crab rangoon, but I was hoping for that smoked salmon flavor. \u00a0Just wasn't there, but it's hard to compete with so much cream cheese.The soup bowls are huge! \u00a0The cost is 12.50 for each bowl, but you will not be leaving hungry. \u00a0The bowls are big enough to share and I would recommend sharing if you plan on eating anything else. \u00a0The Udon had peas, asparagus, baby corn, celery, seaweed, zucchini and 2 different kinds of mushrooms. \u00a0The seafood amount was satisfactory. \u00a0Very tasty broth. \u00a0The San Shan Jam Bong had an unexpected red broth. \u00a0The dish is marked spicy and it certainly was that. \u00a0Not too hot to eat though. \u00a0The vegetables were napa cabbage, red onions, scallions, carrots, and zucchini. \u00a0Satisfied with the amount of seafood in this one as well. \u00a0The hot tea was a delight because they bring you the hot water and let you choose your tea from a wooden case. \u00a0Very swank. \u00a0There were a couple of repeat flavors so there weren't quite as many as we first thought, but we ultimately settled on a tropical green tea. \u00a0All the flavors were organic FYI. \u00a0The tea bags are the pyramid shaped ones. We got three refills of \u00a0hot water and that one tea bag lasted through them all. \u00a0The China Mist Iced Tea is bottled, but is also organic and does not have HFCS. \u00a0It's a black tea sweetened with cane sugar. \u00a0The flavor was Tangerine Tea with Pomegranate Juice. \u00a0The server was pleasant and not over bearing. \u00a0He was helpful when we were being nosy about what others had ordered and we just had to know what dish they were eating. \u00a0The after dinner mints are Lifesavers -- pretty fancy.Too full for dessert, but the tempura fried banana will be mine."], ["Daniel W.", "One of my favorite spots in the whole city. The food is just better than any chain restaurant. The staff are really awesome and will help recommend anything. Also the Rangoon are made with smoked salmon and are off the charts good."]]}
