One small request: New stuff on the menu please!!!"], ["Nick G.", "When my wife and my 10-year-old son arrived at Extra-Virgin, we entered a pleasantly decorated, rather swanky, restaurant that clearly catered to a tapas crowd. \u00a0Steven, our server, immediately presented us with menus of exotic dishes. Upon inspection of the menu, we saw that the price for the servings matched the prices of tapas restaurants that we have encountered in Orlando, Atlanta, and New York City. We therefore ordered what we thought was a sufficient array of dishes to satisfy our pallets. \u00a0Our excitement of what we were ordering was enhanced by the smells, aromatic and spicy, emanating from the kitchen. We informed Steven that we were passing through and this would be a one time event for us. He quickly went over what he thought were the best choices to make off the menu, and we complied, wishing to pair a string of dishes that would match a culinary theme. \u00a0He reassured us that \"somehow whatever we chose would all come together in the end.\"How right he was. Our first round of happiness included duck tongue tacos with spicy pickled onions and queso fresco. \u00a0The gamey and sour flavors were attenuated by the small chunks of the creamy cheese, and it was a subtle but nevertheless delicious opening foray. \u00a0The sea salt brought out for us to spoon on as needed brought these flavors out more fully. \u00a0The chickpea fries were stacked in a log cabin presentation which was appealing visually, and the plate contained a smear of a red pepper sauce. \u00a0This was a surprise, for this side was a truly novel experience for us, and we enjoyed the fries immeasurably throughout the meal, using them to soak up the juices of subsequent dishes that followed.Our next round of culinary delights included peppers stuffed with morcilla sausage and Pecorino cheese, both of which gave the piquillos a long finish of several layers of favors. \u00a0In addition, chorizo and fig filled chicken thighs served as a sweet counterpart to the peppers, and its juice was a perfect partner for the aforementioned chick pea fries. \u00a0The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, was a dish traditionally representative of the most basic of American staples: macaroni and cheese. \u00a0In the world of Extra-Virgin, macaroni and cheese exemplifies the concept of gourmet. The dish was prepared with poblano cheese and served in sizzling iron skillets. The combination of creaminess with the brittle crispiness of its shell and its sides which stuck to the pan were pleasant to chew, sensual for the tongue and pallet, and layered with a long finish of taste which paired ably with the locally brewed beers we drank. \u00a0How could so much food fill three people up so satisfyingly? \u00a0I think it was that in the bursts of favors, the sensuality of the textures, and the balance of the foods and spices used to prepare the tapas we were forced to slow down in order to savor every bite. \u00a0By the time we were ready to finish with a cheese assortment, we had to ask Steven if he had begun to prepare it, and upon finding out that he had not, we were able to gratefully cancel as its presentation would have been overload.Steven was right: it all came together, and in a very big and glorious way. It is a great value for the price, for the portions of the tapas were generous. Extra-Virgin unequivocally gets the RSA: the Roaducation Stamp of Approval ... at the highest level! \u00a0Thank you, Michael Smith!"], ["D V.", "My wife and I went here Saturday night for dinner and had a wonderful time. \u00a0We are foodies that love bold, interesting flavors and something outside of the norm for Kansas City. \u00a0Wait times were reasonable, service was impeccable (friendly and attentive without being obtrusive) and the food was amazing.We had the chick pea fries, duck-tongue tacos, heirloom tomato and ricotta cheese plate, avocado and something tacos, and a take off on shrimp ceviche. \u00a0Great twist on the traditional cocktails too.Dinner for two with one round of drinks came to $80 all-in, so it's a little pricey, but I feel it's a good value given the quality and variety of food you receive.We'll definitely be making the drive up from south OP just so we can try more things from the menu!"], ["Zac S.", "This place is fantastic. Berto at the bar creates some great drinks and makes for a fantastic dining experience. Try the pork belly steam bun."], ["Anthony G.", "Having recently moved to KC and looking for some high quality places to eat, I was directed towards Michael Smiths and Extra Virgin. 1. Atmosphere - With an extremely energetic and great bar filled environment it was a really just \"fun\" all over. Staff knows their menu and Bartenders know every drink in the book, how to explain it for a novice, and how to really make your time enjoyable. 2. Food - INCREDIBLE... for a Tapas place, I was extremely impressed. We ordered 5 plates to test. We ordered to hummus, the shrimp fried rice \u00a0(MUST GET), Spanish Meatballs, The hanger steak, and for Dessert the Pear Crostada.3. Bar - As I mentioned earlier the bar was very impressive but many key items stand out. The bar space is great, no matter where you sit, you have en elegant view of everything want to see. I ordered \"The Last Word\" which was a first for me but very enjoyable. It's always fun to be in the middle of actions that witnesses all the and food coming your your way or around it4. ONE MAJOR SETBACK WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE RECEIVING 4 STARS RATHER THAN 5. I never brought this to the attention of any manager but I should have. As mentions earlier we ordered the Hanger Steak, which was delicious by the way. It was prepared with a side of kale but the steak is rarely cooked and sliced thin. After enjoying it, I turned around to notice the cook preparing all of these Steaks so it was clearly a high seller. While watching him, there were no gloves worn whatsoever. I'm not a picky person but growing up in the food industry I know you can't do that. If your chefs are visible to the front of the house, you CANNOT be putting your raw hands on every dish you prepare. That's is just a no-no. I witnessed him grabbing multple raw pieces of meat along with the kale itself and other dishes without washing a single finger or ever decided to use gloves. What bothers me the most is the fact that the restaurant is set up that way in which w can see them prepare... if I can see you touch my food, please give the customer a since of security when eating because it was flat out DISGUSTING. Blood from someones steak then to grab the kale without the use of tongs is unacceptable and I hope Michael is informed. Overall besides one incident, I loved it, I will return, and I will recommend to everyone."], ["Alexander R.", "My wife has been wanting to go here for a while now. I wish we had gone before they got bored with what they were doing. The place was slow. But it still took over 8 minutes to be greeted by our server. We were seated as she cleaned the table next to us. When she continued to clean as I stood waiting to be able to pull out my chair, I thought, please don't let this be my server. She isn't planning on being sat anytime soon. But, as her little bee tattoo buzzed by us two or three times, attending to the neighboring tables, I realized that we were indeed, in her section. My old fashioned was very good. But the food was bland and boring. I've had better deviled eggs at church picnics. Don't get me wrong, the food was all cooked well (only the chicken thighs were burnt). It was quite a disappointment. After spending 20+ years in kitchens, I understand how a restaurant can become content with just churning out the same thing and getting comfortable. But, when I am out for my 20th anniversary, I'm hoping to get something amazing. Or at least intriguing. I hope to try them again, once they have regained interest in what they are doing."], ["Sharon M.", "Really a fun place! Excellent food. Went for happy hour and enjoyed the potato chips with bacon and the super yummy mac & cheese. Only negative was that I had to work pretty hard to get the bartenders' attention."], ["Amber T.", "If I could give 0 stars I would.So, I've loved this place since it opened, and have eaten in several times and have been extremely pleased with their adventurous offerings (I even tried the shaved tuna heart pasta when they had it on the menu!). I live and work in JOCO, and rarely get to eat anything decent for lunch for lack of places near my work. My boss told me he was going to run over to the downtown Arthur Bryant's for lunch today, and did I want anything from there, or the area around it. I was like...\"Hell yeah, Extra Virgin!\". So I call and order the chicken thighs, hangar steak, and churros. I had a little over $20 left on a GC my boss had gotten me for my birthday (knowing how much I loved EV), so I handed it to my boss along with my debit card in case it went over by a couple of bucks, and told him it should be about $21. He calls me from EV saying that it's $27, and I was like \"Whoa nelly...read me the receipt\", he did, and everything was correct except for the hangar steak. On the lunch menu online it is $8, but they charged me $13. I stayed on the phone with my boss and told him to tell the pick-up person (apparently the bartender) this. The guy could not give two fucks less, apparently, and basically said \"it is what it is\". I told my boss to tell the guy that unless they'll honor the price (CLEARLY LISTED) online, then they could keep the hangar steak. So...they kept it (and I'm sure threw it away). Absolutely unbelievable.Guess what EV? Myself, and my SO have probably spent nearly $1,000 total at your place, never mind the friends we've introduced to your food. We won't make that mistake anymore...trust me.

Duck Tongue Tacos... and they were excellent! \u00a0I didn't really know what to expect as I bit into my first mini tapas sized taco, so I closed my eyes and dove in, and the experience was one of the best I've had in regards to tacos. \u00a0The first thing I tasted was a burst of duck, salty, flavorful, and robust. \u00a0Also of note, the texture was much like a duck breast, and less like other tongue tacos I'd tried (lengua-cow tongue). \u00a0Next I got the crunch of the shell, and a bit of the queso fresco. \u00a0Then lastly there was a burst of zesty flavor, which came from the pickled onions. \u00a0I really enjoyed those tacos, and could've easily eaten another order or two!Next up I ordered their tuna Ceviche Tacos. \u00a0They were recommended to me by the waiter as being \"very popular.\" \u00a0Unfortunately, after my first taste I knew that these didn't come close to the Duck Tongue Tacos, and just weren't really that good in general. \u00a0The taco shells were made softer, with less crunch than the previous ones, and I found it to be perfect for the dish. There was a pinch of acidity, which is expected in a ceviche, but then the avocado didn't taste fresh, and there was a lingering unpleasantness to the dish that I couldn't quite place. \u00a0The jicama was an interesting addition that I'm still not quite sure about, since it added a nice texture to the dish, but may have contributed to the dish's overall strange taste. \u00a0Overall, I would skip this dish next time, and can't recommend it.Last, but for the love of FOOD, NOT LEAST!!! I tried their Wood Fried Hangar Steak. \u00a0It was Absolutely Fantastic! \u00a0The meat was perfectly cooked and delicious. The \"bacon marmalade\" and the poached egg perfectly complimented the meat, served lastly with a side of cilantro... Absolute perfection! \u00a0This stole the show in terms of flavor, and has to be my favorite dish of the evening.So I say, try the Duck Tongue Tacos, and have some steak with it! \u00a0Your welcome. \u00a0The place is a bit pricey, so maybe don't come if you're in a buffet type of mood. \u00a0But if you're looking for something to really satisfy your palate, look no further.P.S.

Both were very good! I highly recommend this place to those who enjoy a culinary adventure."], ["James D.", "Extra Virgin, that is a good way to describe myself when it comes to some of the dishes they serve. I was initially intrigued by the odd ingredients of some dishes like pig ear, tripe, beef heart, or duck tongue. I ended up sticking to some normal dishes, the chips where pretty good, they use dried plantains as well as potatoes. I think my favorite where the empanadas and mac 'n cheese.The vibe is very bright and almost funky but not overdone. There is a 30 dollar corking fee if you bring your own bottle of wine. Our waiter was very knowledeable but I think he had a slight ego about himself which was kind of weird. None the less the service was good, the plates come to your table as they become ready, not all at once. My tip is to not finish your first plate but pick at it and wait so you have a few plates to mix around. I think part of the fun is mixing the different dishes together and switching back and forth. I would suggest about 2 plates per person 3 if you are both very hungry."], ["Patty B.", "I was super excited to come back here after my first visit. So excited that it was the only restaurant we HAD to go to no matter what on our very short visit to KC. I don't know if my expectations were just too high but I ended up being pretty disappointed.We went around 1PM or 2PM and there were maybe only 3 tables that were occupied and a couple of people at the bar. No one greeted us and when someone finally showed up, he kind of just pointed to a table. The whole time we were there, the waiter just seemed like he just didn't want it be there that day like walking really slow, avoiding eye contact with us, and not checking up on us at all. And during our lunch, I could see him eating his lunch, which is fine because everyone should have a lunch break but I wasn't expecting to see the waiter eating while working at whats supposed to be a really nice restaurant. About halfway through our meal, another waiter showed up to start her shift, and she starts dusting everything. I think that's pretty darn weird that they just didn't do it before the restaurant opened. And it did bother me that we were eating and there was dust floating around from her dusting.As for the food, we got a few of the same things that were our favorites from the first visit. The duck tongue tacos and pablano Mac & cheese were still good. Everything else was forgettable. I can't even remember what we had which was unlike the first visit when I remembered every dish and how tasty it was. And no delicious cookie with my cappuccino. :(I guess I would go back to this place but my expectations will be really low and if it turns out to be like my second visit then that'll be it."], ["Andrea C.", "My absolute favorite restaurant in Kansas City.

I don't feel that the tapas are very good at all, in fact, I feel like they lack so much flavor! \u00a0In my honest opinion I think La Bodega is better for tapas and I like the environment so much more, but not the one in Leawood (STALE!!) \u00a0When we went in for dinner we ordered a variety of tapas the best were the tuna tacos tiny little things and when you break it down they were worth $4.00 a piece. pffffft. Also we sat in a row of tables by the front entrance and on more than one occasion I was looking at a waiter's ass as I was chewing my food. The service was sub par at dinner.

If you're looking for a restaurant to excite your taste buds, go to Extra Virgin. If you're looking for a place to get a fantastic Old Fashioned, go to Extra Virgin. Bottom line: go to Extra Virgin! I highly recommend trying the \"adventurous\" items on the menu here. If you have never eaten offal before this is the quick and dirty way to get you hooked. The beef heart was more tender than I expected - a testament to the chef - it could have passed as an actual cut of meat rather than heart. The chicken gizzards were more blatantly \"offal\" in nature (may not be the best choice for newbies), but paired with the acidic chimichurri and crunchy pomme frites the dish ended up quite balanced. The pork belly steamed buns were a fun play on traditional Asian pork steamed buns. The pork belly was so luscious with just the right amount of fat remaining and a crispy edge. However, I recommend not letting this dish sit for long. The juices from the ramp garnish, while delicious, seeps all over the place. Over time the fluffy bun becomes soggy and the pork belly loses its crispy edge; you don't want to miss out on these textures so eat it quick. But, my god. What really stole the show was the marrow: rich, gelatinous scoops of it topped with crunchy pickled peppers spread on toasted bread, this dish is not for the faint of heart - or for those watching their heart health. But for everyone else, this is a must-try.I was also impressed at how aesthetically beautiful all the dishes were. It's not easy to make hefty, gray-tinged beef bones look delicate and vibrant, but Extra Virgin achieved that. This restaurant fully demonstrates just what you can do with offal if you're thoughtful about the preparation and presentation. 50% off HH specials until 6pm make this a totally affordable opportunity to treat yourself to this creative and scrumptious culinary experience.It doesn't hurt that I was served the best Old Fashioned (or \"not so old fashioned\" as they like to call it) I've had in KC yet here. The ambience is modern, a touch romantic - it suits the tapas concept well. And to top it all off, our server was jovial, attentive, and helpful.

Bummer.One thing that I rarely see mentioned in a review is the seating in a restaurant and for good reason: it's rarely an issue. But I have to say that my butt was terribly uncomfortable on your chairs. Really. At a restaurant like EV, people should be encouraged to stay a long time and order more and more small plates. But if your patrons are squirming in their chairs due to butt pain, they're not likely to stay for long and work their way through your menu. The service was friendly and efficient.

I think we ended up with seven or eight dishes (four people), and we were definitely satisfied! Everything was yummy, but at the end if the night a hefty bill didn't match the food quantity. \u00a0I think I'd go back during happy hour for sure.

On this visit the salad came out and was prepared with leaf lettuce instead of romaine (there is nothing similar in these two lettuces, so don't even try to fool me). The salad also had just 2 olives in it and a scant few onion slices and tomato. When I mentioned it to the server she commented that the chef had purchased leaf lettuce instead of romaine at the market because it was cheaper and that a new person was preparing the salads! The owner came out to our table and sat down and talked to us and apologized for the food. He was very genuine and appreciative of our business and our comments. It really is nice to have a restaurant owner who understands the importance \u00a0of his customers. The cafe is simple inside, and also has a nice outdoor seating area to enjoy in the warmer weather. They offer free drinks to seniors too! We will definitely patronize the North Kansas City Cafe again."], ["Samantha B.", "I believe in dining locally when possible.

A waiter brought me a soda while I was waiting. The waitresses kept giving me updates and checking on me. The cook/owner came out and asked me if I wanted some additions to the sandwich. The veggie gyro was tasty, with juicy mushrooms and fresh, soft pita. I usually love cucumber sauce, but theirs was just average. I will go back to try their other Greek menu items though. It's a good addition to the ethnic food mix in the area."], ["Jeff K.", "You have to try this place! \u00a0Moe puts love into his food & he goes out of his way to make customers happy.

When I dine in with other people our drinks are promptly refilled and the server does a good job checking up.

But it's worth looking for, especially if you're a TWA fan...let me explain.The owner is a Middle-Eastern born (sorry, Moe, you never said where) gentleman who was laid off from TWA. He's amassed a fairly impressive collection of TWA memorabilia for a place its size, so there's plenty to look at while you're eating some pretty fine chow...He does breakfast; I haven't sampled the menu-but yesterday I heard him tell a customer he'd serve it any time. For lunch and dinner, you can get a fairly standard variety of sandwiches, salads, and American entrees...but I always order off the Mediterranean page. It's a pretty standard variety, but I've never had anything I didn't like-portions are generous, and everything is seasoned beautifully. I had a couscous salad, and it was delicious-warm couscous and veggies (Moe came out and asked me which ones I wanted) over greens with feta cheese, lemon juice, and olive oil. My daughter's lamb gyro was HUGE. I've also enjoyed the hummus and baba ganouj (sp?). Not sure what to get? He has a sampler plate. Still hungry? I'm not a huge fan of baklava, but I do like theirs.Service is very warm and helpful. Prices are VERY resonable-I don't think there's anything over $12, and as far as I know, no liquor service.

I thought the hummus tasted ok but wasn't creamy...more like runny. I don't like baba ganoush so stayed away..my friend seemed to like it though it also looked gummy. The cucumber salad was meh and the pita was toasted though a bit greasy. The spanikopita was a bit greasy as well, but indulgingly so. The whole plate was sprinkled with feta goodness. \u00a0 Next came a gyro which we split. I thought it was good...but then I don't like gyro usually, so if this is an Americanized version of a Greek classic, oh well, at least it was yummy. Pita was soft, meat juicy, tomatoes ripe, cucumber sauce creamy and well seasoned. The only thing I absolutely would never order again was the steak fries that came with the gyro. If that is a predicator of the level of American food, I would stay away. They were obviously frozen, tasteled off, tough, underseasoned. Just yuck.

It's a bit thicker than I typically like, and it's quite peppery. It's good stuff, but not my favorite.

No restaurant experience could truly be 1 star worthy! Perhaps my fellow Gladstonians don't have the refined pallet I do! Turns out I'm wrong, and 1 star is being generous. Let's start with what they got right... Now that that's out of the way, let's focus on the overwhelmingly negative experience. First, the restaurant itself was extremely hot, I've worked in restaurants before, sometimes things happen, but it was significantly hotter inside than it was outside, that's a problem. Second, the prices. At first the prices look fair, $7 for a gyro plate? Shut up and take my money! But come on, $5 for baklava? Baklava that made no effort to hide that it probably came from Sam's? No thanks. Did I mention how hot the restaurant was? Because that didn't go away. Third, my \"server\" decided that talking about living in a frat house, and chit chatting with her coworker was more important than acknowledging or validating my existence. Okay, fair! I'm just some jerk who wants to eat food. Speaking of food that brings me to my fourth point, the portions are tiny! Look at the website, enjoy the juicy tender pieces of meat, by the way enjoy it from afar, because as I was informed upon returning my food (we will get there) \"Oh, that's not actually our food, that's just gyros from the internet.\" Seriously, when I think of gyros I think of lamb/beef/chicken piling out of a delicious pita. What I got were three small strips (not even the length of the pita) of meat that resembled beef jerky (it had clearly been overcooked) on a lukewarm pita. I got my order to go, and in my haste (to feed a family) made the mistake of assuming the things I ordered and paid for were in the bag! NOPE! She forgot my fries (funny story, my server told me she accidentally gave my fries to another customer, but assured me they were in the bag). I called the restaurant and was informed that they hadn't forgotten my fries, I had indeed left them there (which makes sense because clearly I bagged my own food). ALSO! We ordered hummus to go, hummus that they decided to put in a standard to go box which leaked all over everything, YUM! Bag o' hummus!Seriously, I can't explain how terrible the experience was. To summarize, the food is over priced, the service is terrible, the portions are tiny, and the place is way too hot. Don't eat here. Don't take people you dislike here. Don't drive past here if you can help it. THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE! If you want gyros a more fulfilling and less infuriating way to obtain them, is to study Greek for a few years, move there, and get it that way, at least this way when you pay $7 for a gyro combo, you're doing it with devalued Greek currency!Seriously, go somewhere else to eat."], ["Jon B.", "I don't know what people expect for an $8 to $10 lunch, but this place is great.

It's an excellent place to grab take out from and the food is healthier than a lot of alternatives.

Inside shows an older interior with a lot of wear and tear, and a cramped space to boot.The patio on the outside gives a nice view of the people and traffic going down 39th Street West, but lately every time I've been there, all I hear is some pretty intense middle-eastern music blasting through an alarm clock quality speaker system right above my head.

They had super warm pita, and that made it even better. I am not sure if they make their hummus themselves, or if it comes from somewhere else, but it is the perfect consistency, with the perfect amount of spices. The salad was refreshing, and so so delicious. Id be happy to purchase just the green dressing so that I could make my own at home. All of the veggies and lettuce was crisp and very fresh.

I'd never had it, and I love it.They do great takeout (with a couple of dedicated takeout parking spaces in the small lot), and have double the seating in the summer because they put tables out there.Aladdin is now in our regular rotation. Great stuff."], ["Joshua R.", "This place is nuts. Best Mediterranean food in KC followed very very closely by bread for all."], ["Michelle F.", "it's not a fancy place by any means but the food is certainly terrific. Three of us split the Agrabah Appetizer Sampler. The hummus and baba ghanouj were wonderful. The genie dip is bright with citrus and heavy with garlic... so potent and so yummy. The falafel were tender and spicy. The dolmas were a favorite, tender grape leaves and nicely spiced filling. This is served with pita bread fresh from the grill, even sporting a little bit of a char. We had to order a second basket of pita and there wasn't a drop of anything left on the appetizer plate when we finally let the friendly waitress take it.We all ordered sandwiches. My husband the Shawarmah, my sister the lamb gyro, and the Souvlaki chicken for myself. We nibbled and shared, but just a little. No one wanted to give up too much of what they had! Mine was tangy and messy but so good. Tender chicken with yogurt sauce and feta. The sandwiches also came with greek salads. This is not your ordinary greek salad. The lettuce, romaine, was crisp and fresh and had plenty of toppings to steal the show. The dressing has a lot of citrus zing and it's so good you can't not eat it. Completely different from the \"standard\" greek dressing. And you had better believe I cleaned all of that dressing up with the last sliver of warm pita bread. We also ordered a bowl of lentil soup, so warm and creamy. The menu here is very diverse. They even have Koshary! I can't wait to get back and try some of the other items."], ["Michal R.", "I am a huge Mediterranean food person. I love me some gyro meat. It food here was enjoyable. I would definitely go back again. I've had the gyro platter and the chicken kabobs. It makes me really happy that they use sumac, as it is by far my favorite spice, I just wish they didn't use so much oil!! Vegetables are tasty enough, they do not need a gallon of oil! The service was mediocre at best, but an all around decent food experience. Not miraculous, but more than satisfactory."], ["Joanna M.", "My friends have been telling me about this place for a long time.. in fact, they used to go on and on about a certain lentil soup that would change my life. \u00a0Skeptical, I would shake my head and shrug, convinced that no lentil soup was good enough to so rock my culinary senses. \u00a0Of course, I was proved dead wrong. \u00a0Good golly, the lentil soup at Aladdin just takes it up about 100 notches; it is, all at once, delightfully soothing, complex, lemony, and oh so filling. \u00a0I could probably chug a glassful of that stuff now..But that's not all that is amazing at this otherwise nondescript cafe. \u00a0I am so in love with their lemony salad vinaigrette and the beef shawarmah that I ordered was simply on point. \u00a0The beef is juicy, tender, and deliciously flavorful. \u00a0Paired with a soft pita and a yummy tahini sauce, it really can't be beat. \u00a0Aladdin, you have a new loyal customer. \u00a0I will, without shame or fear of retaliation, yell it from the rooftops so others will know: \"YOU HAVE TO TRY ALADDIN'S LENTIL SOUP! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!\""], ["Melinda H.", "I only had the hummus, the lentil soup, & the halum (grilled cheese). They were all very, very good!! The hummus was very smooth & creamy & had a side a jalape\u00f1o chutney that was perfect! So good! The pita was warm & good. The lentil soup was good, def better than usual since I normally don't like lentil soup. But the star attraction was the cheese!! Holy smokes you will be missing out if you don't get it! Soooo good!! I also had the mint tea & it was also good & very relaxing sitting outside people watching \u00a0while I drank my tea :) I will definitely go bank for the cheese & hummus!! And will think about that jalape\u00f1o chutney for a long time!"], ["Blair C.", "The service was good and the food was average, the Agrabah Appetizer Combo was a generous portion, but was lacking in flavor. I did like the Rose lemonade, it was amazing! Perfect for a summer afternoon."], ["Mateo S.", "I enjoy this place, but expectations should be managed. It's not the best and not nearly the worst. For instance I just got their fantastic lentil soup and an order of dolmas. The dolmas were straight-up refrigerated cold as if they'd been made last week and then placed in the container five minutes prior to pick up without even trying to heat them up. So disappointing. The dill chicken is pretty disappointing too. It's dry, bland and only comes with a head of iceberg lettuce on it. Actually, I've never had anything here that I would characterize as \"really good\". I guess their lentil soup is super good, so that's why I'm giving them three stars lol. Otherwise it'd be a two-star affair. (atmosphere and service are God awful.)"], ["Jenny A.", "This food really hit the spot. Everything was delicious and the rice was out of this world."], ["Hayley S.", "If you order a sandwich, you get to choose lentil soup or side salad to start - tough choice! I love their green salad dressing, but this place has hands down the best lentil soup in town. The rosewater lemonade is delicious. They offer free refills, but it's so sweet I can only get through one glass. The sampler platter is a great choice, either for a starter or for your meal - you get falafel (not my favorite), dolmas, hummus, genie dip and baba ghanouj. I LOVE the genie dip - I believe it's just very spicy hummus, but man, is it good."], ["Darcey R.", "Tasty gyros and schwarma. Each comes with a side of Jasmin rice and a choice of soup or salad. I went with the lentil soup and it was surprisingly good. Service was a little slow but nothing to complain about. Prices were good for the amount of food you get. I could see me coming here when I want to sit down an enjoy my food. But if you want a tastier gyro head to Jerusalem Cafe down the street."], ["Lori B.", "What can I say....done.

Spiced beef & lamb goodness w/ veggies on a pita and tzatziki sauce. You get your choice of fries, rice, or feta pasta as a side. I picked the feta pasta which sounded interesting, but wasn't really that good. Oh well, I tried it. It was a nice-sized Gyro as well, so it filled me up. Service was quick and the price was very reasonable -- $6.25 + tax. I haven't tried anything else yet, but I most definitely plan on returning. I am, however, a big gyro fan.

We stopped in for a late lunch today and tried a gyro pita and gyro Greek salad. The restaurant was empty (due to the odd time of day) but the service was fast and friendly. The veg in the salad and pita was fresh and on point. The reason for the low rating was due to the incredibly dry gyro. I noticed it was taken from a pre-shaved container and it must have been left over from the lunch service several hours earlier. The flavor of the meat was decent it was just bone dry.

The fries were delicious, had some sort of seasoning on it, couldn't tell what it was but it was amazing. It's a pretty small place, only had 2 people working when I went but they were still very kind.The set up of the place is similar to chipotle in that you tell them what you want at the beginning and then go down the line telling them what other ingredients you want added.
