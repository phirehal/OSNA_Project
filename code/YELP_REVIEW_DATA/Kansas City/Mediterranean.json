One small request: New stuff on the menu please!!!"], ["Nick G.", "When my wife and my 10-year-old son arrived at Extra-Virgin, we entered a pleasantly decorated, rather swanky, restaurant that clearly catered to a tapas crowd. \u00a0Steven, our server, immediately presented us with menus of exotic dishes. Upon inspection of the menu, we saw that the price for the servings matched the prices of tapas restaurants that we have encountered in Orlando, Atlanta, and New York City. We therefore ordered what we thought was a sufficient array of dishes to satisfy our pallets. \u00a0Our excitement of what we were ordering was enhanced by the smells, aromatic and spicy, emanating from the kitchen. We informed Steven that we were passing through and this would be a one time event for us. He quickly went over what he thought were the best choices to make off the menu, and we complied, wishing to pair a string of dishes that would match a culinary theme. \u00a0He reassured us that \"somehow whatever we chose would all come together in the end.\"How right he was. Our first round of happiness included duck tongue tacos with spicy pickled onions and queso fresco. \u00a0The gamey and sour flavors were attenuated by the small chunks of the creamy cheese, and it was a subtle but nevertheless delicious opening foray. \u00a0The sea salt brought out for us to spoon on as needed brought these flavors out more fully. \u00a0The chickpea fries were stacked in a log cabin presentation which was appealing visually, and the plate contained a smear of a red pepper sauce. \u00a0This was a surprise, for this side was a truly novel experience for us, and we enjoyed the fries immeasurably throughout the meal, using them to soak up the juices of subsequent dishes that followed.Our next round of culinary delights included peppers stuffed with morcilla sausage and Pecorino cheese, both of which gave the piquillos a long finish of several layers of favors. \u00a0In addition, chorizo and fig filled chicken thighs served as a sweet counterpart to the peppers, and its juice was a perfect partner for the aforementioned chick pea fries. \u00a0The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, was a dish traditionally representative of the most basic of American staples: macaroni and cheese. \u00a0In the world of Extra-Virgin, macaroni and cheese exemplifies the concept of gourmet. The dish was prepared with poblano cheese and served in sizzling iron skillets. The combination of creaminess with the brittle crispiness of its shell and its sides which stuck to the pan were pleasant to chew, sensual for the tongue and pallet, and layered with a long finish of taste which paired ably with the locally brewed beers we drank. \u00a0How could so much food fill three people up so satisfyingly? \u00a0I think it was that in the bursts of favors, the sensuality of the textures, and the balance of the foods and spices used to prepare the tapas we were forced to slow down in order to savor every bite. \u00a0By the time we were ready to finish with a cheese assortment, we had to ask Steven if he had begun to prepare it, and upon finding out that he had not, we were able to gratefully cancel as its presentation would have been overload.Steven was right: it all came together, and in a very big and glorious way. It is a great value for the price, for the portions of the tapas were generous. Extra-Virgin unequivocally gets the RSA: the Roaducation Stamp of Approval ... at the highest level! \u00a0Thank you, Michael Smith!"], ["D V.", "My wife and I went here Saturday night for dinner and had a wonderful time. \u00a0We are foodies that love bold, interesting flavors and something outside of the norm for Kansas City. \u00a0Wait times were reasonable, service was impeccable (friendly and attentive without being obtrusive) and the food was amazing.We had the chick pea fries, duck-tongue tacos, heirloom tomato and ricotta cheese plate, avocado and something tacos, and a take off on shrimp ceviche. \u00a0Great twist on the traditional cocktails too.Dinner for two with one round of drinks came to $80 all-in, so it's a little pricey, but I feel it's a good value given the quality and variety of food you receive.We'll definitely be making the drive up from south OP just so we can try more things from the menu!"], ["Zac S.", "This place is fantastic. Berto at the bar creates some great drinks and makes for a fantastic dining experience.

Atmosphere - With an extremely energetic and great bar filled environment it was a really just \"fun\" all over. Staff knows their menu and Bartenders know every drink in the book, how to explain it for a novice, and how to really make your time enjoyable. 2. Food - INCREDIBLE... for a Tapas place, I was extremely impressed. We ordered 5 plates to test. We ordered to hummus, the shrimp fried rice \u00a0(MUST GET), Spanish Meatballs, The hanger steak, and for Dessert the Pear Crostada.3. Bar - As I mentioned earlier the bar was very impressive but many key items stand out. The bar space is great, no matter where you sit, you have en elegant view of everything want to see. I ordered \"The Last Word\" which was a first for me but very enjoyable. It's always fun to be in the middle of actions that witnesses all the and food coming your your way or around it4. ONE MAJOR SETBACK WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE RECEIVING 4 STARS RATHER THAN 5. I never brought this to the attention of any manager but I should have. As mentions earlier we ordered the Hanger Steak, which was delicious by the way. It was prepared with a side of kale but the steak is rarely cooked and sliced thin. After enjoying it, I turned around to notice the cook preparing all of these Steaks so it was clearly a high seller. While watching him, there were no gloves worn whatsoever. I'm not a picky person but growing up in the food industry I know you can't do that. If your chefs are visible to the front of the house, you CANNOT be putting your raw hands on every dish you prepare. That's is just a no-no. I witnessed him grabbing multple raw pieces of meat along with the kale itself and other dishes without washing a single finger or ever decided to use gloves. What bothers me the most is the fact that the restaurant is set up that way in which w can see them prepare... if I can see you touch my food, please give the customer a since of security when eating because it was flat out DISGUSTING. Blood from someones steak then to grab the kale without the use of tongs is unacceptable and I hope Michael is informed.

I wish we had gone before they got bored with what they were doing. The place was slow. But it still took over 8 minutes to be greeted by our server.

She isn't planning on being sat anytime soon. But, as her little bee tattoo buzzed by us two or three times, attending to the neighboring tables, I realized that we were indeed, in her section. My old fashioned was very good. But the food was bland and boring. I've had better deviled eggs at church picnics. Don't get me wrong, the food was all cooked well (only the chicken thighs were burnt). It was quite a disappointment. After spending 20+ years in kitchens, I understand how a restaurant can become content with just churning out the same thing and getting comfortable.

I had an a Groupon to use and thought it would be a great time to try the food since we were literally a few businesses away. We walked over and my sister's friend was holding her shoes but had on sandals so her nails could finish drying.

Needless to say we began to feel uncomfortable. We inquired about the buffet and my little sister because she's pregnant decided not to order as her stomach was up set but the rest of us ordered the buffet. I think the man we encountered early was upset by this because they sat us parallel to the door, then he opened the door so the cold air from outside would blow directly on my pregnant sister. She says she heard him say under his breathe, \"I better not hear a complaint\". Other patrons including another pregnant woman seemed to be surprised the door would be opened when it was windy, cold, and raining (lightly) outside. The same man we encountered earlier who I by now assumed was the owner walked around and was polite to other customers but not to us which i didn't understand as we were first timers and very polite. The food was okay but the buffet was messy and not labeled well. Do not waste your money here go where they respect and value customers.

You can't tell from the name, so it could be a surprise as soon as you open the door.To be honest, it doesn't impress you at all when you walk in.

I wouldn't be surprised that the items were actually re-heated because of the \"ding\" sound I mentioned above. However I was pleasantly surprised by the beef and chicken kabob. The chicken breasts pieces are very juicy, most, tender and flavorful. The same attributes apply to the (ground) beef patty as well. There's not much presentation to the dish, with rice, \"house salad\" and grilled tomato filling up the rest of the plate. I really wanted to try the fillet mignon or the hen, but the're not available (or not offered anymore). If I were to visit again, I would definitely give the lamb dishes a try.

Sounds like a massive amount of food, but it was a small enough sample of each. I ate most of it - minus some rice and hummus. It was $10 and worth every penny. The meat and rice were very flavorful. Might have been the best hummus I've ever had. The falafal were good. The green stuff was good - think it was the tabouli. Would definitely return - AWESOME food!"], ["Daniela G.", "I've been on the hunt for some good Mediterranean food since I moved to KC, on that hunt I have dinned at 3 or 4 places that would do in a pinch, but Habashi House, after yesterday's lunch, is my go to from now on! \u00a0No matter where I am, where I go I always, hands down, go for the veggie platter...or whatever it's called at any given place, and if available a lentil soup...here it's the House Combo: hummus, baba ganoush, dolmas, falafel, tabule and pita bread. \u00a0I feel like this gives me an edge on the reviews too because it's all an even playing field. \u00a0Let's start with the curve ball, the soup - while thinner than other lentil soups I've had this is by far the most flavor packed! \u00a0I was raised on extremely flavorful ethic food, so my pallet is looking for something more than just lentil scented water - Habashi House's lentil soup was incredible and zesty, just how I like it. \u00a0On to the main event, the house combo - I will say that I have had their hummus and pita before, so I knew how good it was before came in - I just can't help grabbing some when out doing my weekly produce shopping. Aside from their deliciously creamy hummus, their dolmas were probably some of the best I've ever had (sorry grandma)! \u00a0The falafel was moist and flavorful as well! \u00a0 LIke I said before - this is my new go to for fab and delicious Mediterranean food and, let's be real... it should be yours too!"], ["Perry P.", "Bottom Line Up Front: Cheap Prices. City Market location. Authentic middle eastern food. Located in the City Market, it's easy to tell which restaurant is worth trying based on their traffic during lunch. The fiance and I go to the City Market 2-3 times a month and I've always noticed how crowded this place got. So, we decided to grab lunch here over the weekend. The restaurant is a hole in a wall joint. No frills, random middle eastern decor and mismatch furniture. You wait in line, order your food, sit down, and wait until someone yells out your ticket number (seems like a good system I guess, works for them as far as I can see). Initially I wanted to try their felafel sandwich (use to love them when I was in Iraq, even though we shouldn't have been eating them due to sanitary concerns, oh wells, still alive). But, I ended up getting the shwarma wrap with rice. I use to eat shwarma's 2-3 times a month back when I was in high school/college in Houston, which were amazing. So, my expectations were pretty high before I took the first bite. Unfortunately, it didn't wow me. It was good, just all the flavors didn't really come together for me. I ended up drenching it in tzatziki sauce. The rice was very good though. Together the dish was not bad. I wouldn't get it again though.I will come back some day and give the felafel a try. If you're wanting quick, authentic, and cheap middle eastern food, you can't really go wrong with this place. It just won't really wow you."], ["Thomas M.", "We enjoyed a beef kabob with some good flavor and tasty rice. HH had \u00a0good atmosphere and I really enjoyed it.

Let me count the ways:1) The woman that runs the cash register is the friendliest woman alive. I'd give her a hug if that wouldn't be super creepster of me. 2) The gyros, while a bit smaller than at other places, is so delicious. They have the best pita of all time, and the warm meat mixed with the pillowy bread and tangy tatziki sauce is a sensation to behold.3) In my limited dolma-eating experiences, these are the best dolmas I've had. Same goes for the falafel. 4) Bulk hummus. DELICIOUS bulk hummus.5) Coke Zero!6) On a nice day being able to sit outside of the main restaurant and have the fresh breeze and the bustle of the market waft over meWell that's 6 ways that I love them, but I only have 5 stars to give. Habashi House, take them all."], ["Patrick M.", "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City. The falafel is so good. In the winter they have the best lentil soup. The people that own it are so nice and friendly."], ["Cathy C.", "Favorite Middle Eastern restaurant, without a doubt. Nothing fancy about it, but it fits perfectly into its surroundings. And yes, the woman at the counter couldn't be sweeter. The first time I ate here was right after 9/11, and they had put up a sign saying how much they love America and how proud they are to be here. I wanted to hug her right there.I think I've pretty well eaten my way through the menu, and never had anything I didn't love. Felafel is my favorite, with its delicate crispy crust and tender, beautifully seasoned insides. The smoky baba ghanouj is my second favorite. A sandwich is just a pita pocket dripping with the stuff-messy joy! And while the rice at some Mediterranean places is underwhelming, theirs is delicious-almonds, mint and mystery seasoning with enough olive oil that it isn't dry. It's nice to sit outside in nice weather to avoid the crush of waiting patrons inside, and I don't know of any other Mediterranean restaurant with a store next door if you're inspired to try your hand at home!"], ["Nadia A.", "It was awful and shit dirty with spread insects around the tables.

They also have vegetarian dolmas. I've tried the combo, the grape leaves, the hummus and the falafel options. All are tasty.Take out service is fast.Their rice side is good, but oh so hard not to get hummus.And to top it off, no entree is more than $9.99 and that's meat.Love it.

Its located on hospital hill from 11 to 2pm and on Grand downtown about 12th street 10pm to 3am Friday and Saturday. There is no place to get Gyros downtown or midtown that is worth bothering. Mr Gyro in OP is great but who wants to drive 30 minutes. This place does not skimp, and they are perfect every time. I get them no hot sauce, no lettuce and no cheese. Perfect. The greek salad is also fantastic. Very friendly guys working."], ["Matt E.", "Have you seen all these food trucks showing up around KC? woooo-eee those things are getting fancy! What with all their locally sourced, vegan, gluten free, free range wonderfulness? That's all well and good for you high-falootin foodies out there, but some people like their food truck experiences with a little less pretension. Something tried and true. Something like Gyro Express.I remember stumbling towards Gyro Express for over a decade now, as a barely-legal drinker coming into Kansas City to party in Westport. 3:00 AM would roll around, and I'd stumble from whatever terrible bar that i thought at the time was awesome, heading into the general direction of this food truck. To this day I love their gyros. They taste like nostalgia. And tzatziki sauce. Yes, it is true. Gyro express makes a killer gyro. All lamby and tzatziki-ey. Pillowly pita. mmmmm. \u00a0What they also make is a killer falafel sandwich. Delightful fried balls of chickpeas wrapped in pita, served with the aforementioned heavenly sauce, lettuce and tomato? Vegetarian street night gloriousness. Today, this truck can generally be found in Westport in the evening, though I have seen it show up at 13th and Main off of the Power and Light District. I'm not going to say it's the best food ever. Often times I will pass it up for something a bit more highbrow. But when you're in a certain frame of mind, it more than hits the spot."], ["KK V.", "Fantastic Gyro- loaded with goodies!They have great Gyro's for a great price. \u00a0As of 2/11/13, you can get a combination Gyro (lamb and beef) for $3.75, the portion is large and you get get it spiced up with their chile sauce. \u00a0They are regularly parked out at Hospital Hill between the School of Pharmacy Building and Children's Mercy from about 11:00-2:30 (I could be wrong this is an approximate). \u00a0The service is quick. \u00a0Through cold, wind, snow, rain, and shine, I'll be there. \u00a0I've been to Chicago, New York, and L.A., this family serves up gyros that are just as good, and you can't beat the price. \u00a0Weekends you can find them at PNL, he price goes up to $5.00 but still well worth it after the Bars are closing. \u00a0Think of the price as shift differential and they have to put up with drunks!

The falafel sandwich is great for when you want a change of pace.They don't just carry middle eastern lunch items... there's burgers, tuna sandwiches, club sandwiches, and Philly steak sandwiches.Their prices are low (hence the heavy flow of students who love them)... all the sandwich and meal items run under $3.50 with sodas running about $0.75 = less than the machines in the schools. \u00a0I typically get a gyro and baklava for a total of $4.50... and tip the extra $0.50 from my fiver.Oh, today while I was in line...
