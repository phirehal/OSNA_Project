I have to downgrade my original review. 

My first experience, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered delivery, and the food arrived quickly.  Almost too quickly, but I suppose most of the food is cooked in batches anyway.  The sweet and sour chicken wasn't quite what I was expecting.  It was more like pieces of chicken fingers cut up.  Still tasty.  The hot & sour soup was really delicious.  The portion sizes are large.  

My second experience wasn't nearly as positive.  The food took an hour to arrive.  My problem though is not that it took an hour, but that the food was probably sitting in the containers for that entire hour.  It was cold, and the sweet and sour chicken was soggy - to the point that it was inedible.  I also ordered a spring roll that wasn't good.  Overall, a waste of $20.
