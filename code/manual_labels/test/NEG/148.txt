I came here a while ago for brunch. Perhaps brunch is not their best feature, but at least the staff here is EXTRA nice, very friendly and super enthusiastic to help you.

I had a friend who required accommodations and they were very good about it as he had been there before. We sat at the comfy couches which were awkward for eating in general and had some decent food. I would say money for value there are much better Mexican places in the city and much better food.

However, I think this place has a very unique atmosphere that you probably won't find at many other places. Many regulars are like family, and the staff treat them just like that. I probably wouldn't come back again for food, but hey maybe a drink or two?
