Because I wanted to try at least one more dish before writing a blog entry about it, I returned for a second sampling.

Tamarind chicken wings. Tandoori shrimp. Penne tikka masala with shrimp. Pakola.

The tamarind chicken wings were so good that I didn't bother being proper with a knife and fork. I used my fingers and licked them when I was done. The tandoori shrimp came with a side of tamarind rice, chutneys, a makhani sauce, and achar. As hearty as this dish was, it was still light enough that I was able to finish all of it. The penne tikka masala with shrimp was an interesting fusion between Italian (pasta penne) and Indian (tikka masala). Loved it! And I washed it all down with a Pakistani cream soda called pakola. (Pakolas and Jibarittos are now my favourite carbonated sodas.)

I had a different server this time, but the service was still tops. Tandoor Char House made the cut for the blog. They're worth it.
