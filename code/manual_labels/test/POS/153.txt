The decoration is unique, definitely like the concept. But as a Latin girl it offends me to be made fun of because I couldn't handle how spicy every dish was. Just because it's "authentic Mexican food" it doesn't mean it should give my mouth sores.  Most great or not so great restaurants will at least give you the option. I've been to Mexico and I've had plenty of delicious authentic Mexican food that was not overly  spicy. For those who love the Heat this is your home. 
Atmosphere is amazing! Too bad I didn't go there for the music.
