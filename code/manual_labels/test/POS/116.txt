I think I have a new found love for Italian after dinner last night....maybe it's just new found love for Sapori Trattoria. I tend to avoid Italian cuisine because I don't have an affinity for pasta or pizza. But given some raving reviews, I got curious to try. They had good seafood options and the dishes are well portioned that they can be shared. 

We ordered mussels in white sauce as a starter. These are rather jumbo sized mussels. I opted for the fresh bread from the bread basket to pick up the broth than the garlic toasts that it came with. Unfortunately, we were already getting full from the fresh "crack" bread basket since it took a while for our main entrees to arrive. 

I am so so so so very appreciative of our waitress who suggested to get the half order of the Zuppa di Pesce (A Sapori classic) for 2 people. She was open and asked how much leftovers we wanted. We ordered this spicy and it came in a fairly large bowl brimming with a variety of fresh seafood. (I can't wait to eat these leftovers!). We also ordered the Pasta Contadino which was good contrast to the seafood dish. I do like orecchiette...(ok I know, as a pasta hater I do have a few preferences in shape.)  

Overall, shame on me for being skeptical to try this place before! The food was great and so was the service. Looking forward to returning.
