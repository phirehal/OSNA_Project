Found this place while waiting for our Asia SF reservation. Loved it so much, we came back after the show, and probably spent more time here than at the club!

If I could create a vibe in my own house, this would be it. Amazing, unique cocktails, friendly, chill staff, eclectic, Dia de los Muertos decor, comfy couches and perfect mood lighting.

The tamarind margarita is FIRE, and their house shot (made into a cocktail), is a spicy, gingery, cucumbery, lemony dream.

Will be coming here every time I am in SoMa.
