One of the best Indian restaurants in town! The service is excellent and so is the food. We went with a group of 9 and they were able to accommodate us with a reservation on Friday night at 8pm.

As a table, we got the house salad, garlicky buttery naan (yummmmmm!), chaat fries (spiced curly fries, also a "must get") and with a Yelp check in a ceviche app. The naan came out with a white sauce, green sauce, and brown sauce, as well as a side of spicy tangy pickled carrots and cabbage (supposedly the owner's grandmother's recipe). But seriously, this naan was lick your fingers good. 

The main entrees came out soon after. My bf got the beef nehari which was pretty spicy but had a deep, rich hearty flavor (almost like a beef stew). I got the lamb tikka which was SO savory and the lamb was really tender. I had gotten full already 25% way through, but kept eating because it was that good. Everyone at my table finished their meals and enjoyed the wonderfully intimate dining setting that we had. I would definitely go back!
