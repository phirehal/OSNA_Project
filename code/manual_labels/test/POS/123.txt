Came with my siblings.  Ordered:
Paneer Tandoori - liked the charred taste but not worth $15
Matar Paneer- gravy and paneer tasty but too salty and did not like the green beans in them
Baingin Bharatha- the eggplant was uncooked, so we did not eat it- got credit for that
Naan Assortment - nothing special- didnt appreciate no garlic presence for the garlic naan -_-
Salad - not good at all
Raita- too sweet but tasted good with rice
Achar- eh
The service was great and very accomadating. Too bad the food was a miss but we still the made the most of the night :)
