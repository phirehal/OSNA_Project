I recently payed another visit to this restaurant with my family.

We ordered veggie samosa, tamarind wings, penne pasta, chili chicken biryani, assorted naan basket, and a mixed grill platter. Some entrees were very tasty while others need a little work.

I really liked the samosas, they were very crispy and filled with potatoes. I enjoyed the penne pasta, and I thought the dish has improved since the last time I was here. It was made up of the tikka masala sauce, and I thought that the sauce was delicious.

The tamarind wings were pretty good. The meat was very tender and juicy.

The mixed platter was not very good. I thought that the seekh kabob, grilled chicken breast, and shrimp were all very dry. They were also not spicy enough. 

The chilli chicken biryani was not that great, and there was not much chicken in it.

The naan was was a mix of plain, paneer and garlic naan. Next time, I would just order the garlic naan it was very yummy.

However, the strawberry lassi was very tasty and full of the taste of fresh strawberries. It was perfectly made.

The service was good and everything arrived in a timely manner.
