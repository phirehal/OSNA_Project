Tried this place for the first time last night for a friend's birthday. It was a group of about 25 people. The service was phenomenal. We had two servers I only remembered one of their names which was Heather. The bruschetta with the avocado was awesome and also the calamari was one of the best I've had. I ordered the gnocchi something which was the reason I gave 4/5 because it was not very flavorful.
