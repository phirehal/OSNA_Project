First of all, I love how they take reservations. I get that places are busy in Chicago and they want everyone to gave the same chance at waiting for a table. But I really appreciate the ability to make a reservation and eat t a GREAT place when I want to, without having to wait for an hour or two.

A gf and I went on a Saturday eve and sat outside. What a lovely night and a fantastic experience. Meg waited on us and just topped the night off with her smile, charm and professionalism!

We started with an app special that was avocado, tomatoes and parmesan on garlic toast. OMG. For entrees, she got the lobster ravioli, which was ridiculous. If you want specifics on how delicious it was, read all the other reviews. They give you all the detail you could want :).  I got the shrimp and broccoli pasta special that was out of this world! The portions were incredibly large as well, so I had a big 'ol plate to take home to my sweetie!

After a couple of glasses of wine, great conversation with a good friend, and an amazing dinner, we decided to get the chocolate/hazelnut panna cotta. Oh my word.....just get it. You'll understand why I'm speechless on the topic!
