Super yummy tacos with fresh ingredients. I had the mission and the ahi tacos. The mission taco had a few big prawns and the ahi tuna also had a good deal of nicely seared chunks of tuna. The toppings, which I couldn't quite tell what was what since they all kinda blended together, complemented the protein and added different textures. 

The dining room is large and clean, with many big communal tables. I would definitely come back to try some other items and the horchata coffee
