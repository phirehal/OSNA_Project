Went to Mateo's Taqueria yesterday with some friends for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised. I had never heard of the place before but a friend found it on Yelp and wanted to try it out.

Because it's located in the Mission, I was expecting a hole in the wall, but the ambiance blew my expectations away. The restaurant is very clean and modern. Vibrant bright colored walls with hanging bistro lights from wall to wall. 

I ordered the Chorizo Burrito which had Chorizo sausage and potatoes. It was so flavorful that I didn't even need to add any salsa. My only minor complaint is for the price I would've like it be a bit bigger... guess I'll just have to order two next time. We also got the nachos with Avocado and carne asada. That was pretty good as well. 

Warning, the Haberno Salsa is HOT. I'm not stranger to spicy foods, but this thing burned my mouth. I just stuck with the Tomatina instead. 

Parking isn't the best around the area, but its conveniently located 3 blocks from 24th St. Mission Bart station for those that do not want to deal with parking. 

I would recommend this place to any Mexican food lover as it's not your typical Taqueria. It's a nice blend of traditional mexican and modern hipster.
