This place is awesome! I've been here at least 20 times and the great food, atmosphere, and changing beer menu are what keep me coming back.

For vegetarians there are some pretty great tasting options. My favorite is the Mermaid Taco which has fried cauliflower in it (SO GOOD). I also really like the vegetarian Tostadita, and the Pete's No Meat with black beans is pretty good too.

This place sometimes gets really busy during Friday lunch and dinner, so be prepared to wait in a line. The food is worth the wait! When it's busy it sometimes get's hard to find a place to sit. It may seem annoying, but I always end up finding a spot.

The tables along the edges of the restaurant have phone charging cables!

Also, this place is cash only. There's an ATM inside but come prepared so you don't have to pay those ATM fees
