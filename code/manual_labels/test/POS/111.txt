I went on a Monday night with a friend and we were surprised to learn that Monday nights for $20 a person you get a four course, family style meal. It was such an unbelievable value. Between the two of us, we had leftovers for days. The food was really excellent too and you were not limited in choices for the $20 special. We were even able to order lobster ravioli that was by far our favorite of all the yummy dishes. Our server was extremely friendly (my friend felt he might have been a little too friendly, but who am I to resist the flattery?!).

Our friends were even so impressed with the staff; service, wine selection, and food that they've decided to have their wedding reception here in May so I can't wait to see how this restaurant manages to blow me away in this capacity.
