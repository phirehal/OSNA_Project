Ambiance- colorful, modern and clean taqueria with airy high ceiling. 

Foods- tried a trio of tacos: 
1) sweet/firm cubes of seared Ahi Ahi with crunchy pickled carrots and onions- lovely! 
2) super crispy beer battered cod with thinly sliced cabbages- refreshing- I'll eat more cabbage if it always come with these crispy fried fish! 
3) a high pile of steak and shrimp (which reminded me of surf and turf)- nicely seasoned and very balance
Their roasted habaneros salsa is A+ if u love spicy. I'll ask for extra extra tins on next visit. 

Drink- only had their signature iced horchata+ coffee drink- cool dose of caffein on sunny day. Cant wait till they get a liquor license- i'll ask for an extra shot of something in this drink ;-)
