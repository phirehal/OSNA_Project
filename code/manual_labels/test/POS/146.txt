The short: delicious Mexican fusion food, perfect for post-work eats

My friend surprised me with this spot. When she sent the name, I thought she misspelled it as Garage haha. This place is very informal, perfect for a night of drinks in the city or a post-work hangout spot. It's in this janky section of SoMa (approx. 10 min. walk from Market St.) and if my friend had not shown me the door, I would've walked right past it. Hint: read the Garaje sign painted on the wall on the left. The door is that black door to the right.

Walk to the very back to place an order and then take the placard to a table where somebody will bring the food to you. Napkins and utensils are also at the tables. There are booths for two or four, and a large table at the entrance for groups. I didn't know there was an upstairs seating until the very end. Ah, next time!

We shared the carne asada fries, which are so addicting and very filling. For myself, I ordered the ahi tuna avocado taco. Ahh, so yum.
