We went looking for lunch and decided that it was going to be Garaje......when we arrived the Uber the driver said "That looks closed!" We decided to push on and try our luck. It was a great decision.

The food was great - everything we had was so good. We shared the Crab Cake with Coleslaw, the Tuna and Avocardo Taco and the Thai Prawn Taco. Taste was great and presented really well. Amongst the best Tacos I have ever had. The service is really efficient and the people are helpful.

The fit out is full on, fun and different. It is a new world when you step inside this place and there is so much to look at ones eyes get very busy and tired!

There are a wide range of local beers on tap.....this place fits for many circumstances whether it be lunch, dinner or a light bite. Whatever it is, we will certainly be back.
