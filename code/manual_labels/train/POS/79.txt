Jesus, we ordered so much food that all I can remember is that I was on the brink of exploding. And the only reason why I was going to blow up is that everything was so good and I wanted to eat it all. The service was only good because it seemed like the owner was running the tables and picking up the slack of all the other waiters. If it wasn't for her, we would have been pretty upset because the other waitstaff were pretty incompetent. 

Will definitely be back for more in the future!
