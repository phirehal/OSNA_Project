We made reservations for Sunday night dinner.  Lovely little space with nice ambiance.  It's cozy and great for a group.  

Everything was superb.  The bread was hearty crusty and fresh.  

The lobster ravioli was exceptional, meaty with a hearty saucy.  It's not an overly pungent or powerful flavor.  

The cauliflower sausage Contadino was savory, tasteful and unique.  Excellent combination. 

We ordered half portions of each pasta and we're glad we did!  These were plentiful so I'm sure the regular sizes are huge.  

Bucatini Carbonara is very rich and creamy.  Perfect flavor. 

We also tried tiramisu which was light but had a distinctive coffee flavor.  Very good.  Service was wonderful.  

Overall we had a delicious fine meal!
