Came here last night- solid Indian food with good service!  I'm not surprised, since it's in River North and not new anymore. Menu was solid, and we enjoyed an appetizer, three entrees (more than enough for 3 people) and a Naan order.  Free "mini-naan" came out to start, and overall everything was delicious.  Solid service.  I wish I'd seen a few non-wine drinks on the menu, but I didn't ask since I didn't want it enough.  

I'll come back again!
