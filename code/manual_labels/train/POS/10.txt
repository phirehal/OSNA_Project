My husband and I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place and were not disappointed! 

I often miss the simple street foods of China which I've been lucky enough to experience in my travels for work. This place brought me right back there. The soup dumplings were wonderful as was the mapo tofu over rice, wine chicken and garlic cucumbers. These are definitely authentic dishes and many Americans will likely be put off by the texture of the steamed "wine chicken", served chilled but for anyone who knows what to expect, it's a very solid dish and is delicious!

The menu is temporary for their soft opening and I'm greatly looking forward to their more extensive menu, especially in the soup dumpling category!t
