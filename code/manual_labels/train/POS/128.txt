The logo struck me, I knew this place was going to be classy. It was. The lighting, decor, table setting was all excellent, great for formal gatherings too. I checked in and got free side of Ceviche! Yum. It was shrimp, fresh chopped vegetables, all sitting on papar. We ordered karahi, t-bone steak, garlic naans, and a mixed grill plate. The karahi was amazing. The t-bone steak was okay, because they put tenderizer on the outside, it ruined the consistency of how steak should be cooked, charred on the outside. They brought out a salad on the house too! Overall had a good time and good food.
