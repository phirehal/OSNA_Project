After walking by this multiple times hoping for it to open (there's a severe lack of good Asian food in our immediate area, and definitely no xiao long bao within a 3 mile radius), we finally got to try it!

We arrived a little after 7pm on a Monday night, and all the tables were full. We ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork potstickers, the fried chicken fillet noodle soup and the pork mapo doufu. The cashiers were very friendly, and were taking orders on iPads - I really appreciate when establishments use modern technology. Service was quick, we barely had time to check out the very visible soup dumpling prep station of the kitchen and sit down, and they were calling our order number.

Now for the food - being huge xiao long bao aficionados, we were impressed with Yaso Tangbao's version - very savory, fresh, and the wrapper wasn't too thick. We polished that off really quickly, and are thrilled that we don't need to make the trek to Chinatown anymore to get our fix! The pork mapo doufu with the two fried eggs on top was delicious and our next favorite. The fried chicken fillet noodle soup was a little weird but good. Unfortunately, we greatly disliked the pork potstickers - we could barely taste the pork, it tasted just like sticky rice. The xiao long bao and mapo doufu more than made up for it though!

Overall, we are very impressed with the service, food, cleanliness, and will definitely be back. So happy to have this in our neighborhood!
