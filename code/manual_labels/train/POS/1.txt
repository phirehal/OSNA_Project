The neighborhood is changing for the better.  This newly opened little gem just opened up and it's definitely a breath of fresh air.  This is a definite Chinatown style restaurant with more authentic food than you would get at the majority of places around town.  An added bonus for it being in downtown Brooklyn which has a bunch of Americanized places.

You can get real soup dumplings here.  And I especially liked that they weren't completely loaded (i.e. no burning hot soup all over the place after biting)

I also tried their veggies over pan fried noodles.  Also amazing.  This will be my go to place during the cold winter months since it's close to where I work.
