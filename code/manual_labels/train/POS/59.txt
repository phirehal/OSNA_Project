These are the best Xiao Long Bao's I've ever had. 

What is a Xiao Long Bao
-Soup Dumplings filled with hot soupy broth. You eat with a little soy sauce vinegar and thin slices of ginger. For the noob to this area, this is what you get when you come to Joe's Shanghai.

Instructions: 
-Gently lift the XLB out of the steamed basket with tongs and place in soup spoon (careful they break easily)
-Take a small bite off the top, sip the hot broth inside
-pour some soy sauce vinegar inside the dumpling
-consume the rest of the dumpling
-REPEAT

Crab Xiao Long Bao ($8.25) 
"Crab Meat with Pork Meat Steamed Buns" on the menu. Eight little pockets of gold. Skin is thin, inside is super soupy and rich broth, and the meat themselves are delicious.

Pork Xiao Long Bao ($6.25)
"Pork Steamed Buns" on the menu. Again delicious. May I note too that these XLBs are pretty decently sized!
