If you like authentic steam dumplings, this is where you need to be. The skin is thin, meat filling is juicy and with rich hot soup oozing into my mouth. Just like the way it is in Shanghai. Other street foods are great addition to the menu. The curry chicken is surprisingly tasty! Tender, juicy and flavorful. 
Travelled all the way from Manhattan over and worth it! Much better than joe's Shanghai.
