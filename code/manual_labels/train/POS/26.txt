The Spicy Diced Pork Noodle Soup was awesome, a very satisfying lunch.  Tons of flavor and the perfect amount of heat.  The place was crowded and lively on a weekday during lunch time, but the staff was friendly, I got my food quick, and was able to snag a seat to enjoy my delicious soup.  I'm really excited this place opened in Downtown Brooklyn -- it is now officially added to my lunchtime rotation.  I'll be back to try some soup dumplings!
