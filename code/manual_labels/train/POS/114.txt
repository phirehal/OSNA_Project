Italian food at it's finest. We ordered carry-outs and they were phenomenal. We can not wait to go back and eat at the restaurant. I ordered Vegetable Lasagna. It was prepared with fresh pasta ( no curly edge), with many different veggies and was very cheesy. I enjoyed the fact that it was served not drenched in sauce. Best I have had in a long time. Husband had the Rigatoni Bolognese. He raved about it. For dessert I had the bread pudding. This bread pudding was very much like a pudding, not square and dry, served with a raspberry sauce. 
What I liked when entering the restaurant to pick up my carry out is that it looked like a little neighborhood place where the locals go. Downtown & River North restaurants are full of tourist, so this really had a local feel. I loved it! Beware,it is pricey but I the serving size will allow me a second meal. Portions are unusually large. So worth it
