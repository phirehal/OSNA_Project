Solid 4 stars. 

Since my most extensive experience with xiao long bao has been with Din Tai Fung (been to the locations in Costa Mesa, Arcadia, Seattle, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), this review will focus largely on comparing the two locations.

Where Joe's Shanghai wins:
- Soup:dumpling ratio: There have been times when I bite into DTF's xiao long bao's and the amount of soup was disappointingly small. The XLB at Joe's were so juicy that I had trouble eating it (a good problem to have). 
- Pricing: prices here are substantially cheaper than DTF's, which means more bang for your buck. 

Where Din Tai Fung wins:
- Flavor of the soup: the soup in the XLB at DTF has a noticeably more complex flavor profile. 
- Service: more polite, but I think that comes with the fact that DTF has a more upscale ambiance. Minor win. 
- Other food items: at both DTF and Joe's, I've ordered some of their non-XLB dishes. The food at Joe's overall was just okay - not bad, but not stellar. Their scallion pancakes were good, but it was really fried and rather oily. Their vegetable dish was mediocre, and was actually the most expensive thing we ordered. The noodle soup was rather bland - would definitely skip. DTF's other menu items are overshadowed by their XLB, but it's better than the one's I tried at Joe's. 

Differences:
- Atmosphere: many of the DTF locations are on the nicer end, with a clean, upscale atmosphere. Joe's Shanghai on the other hand is more similar to your typical Asian restaurants - loud and casual. Not a pro or a con in my book for either case. 

Overall, I wish that DTF and Joe's Shanghai's would fuse together - bigger, juicier XLB at a cheaper price, with DTF's soup base. But very solid 4 stars - would definitely go back if I'm in the area.
