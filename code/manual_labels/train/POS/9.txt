Great new Shanghainese restaurant with excellent soup dumplings. They are every bit as good as those at Joe Shanghai (where the chef is from) but without the wait for a table. I also really enjoyed the hot and sour soup. I didn't have one but my friends really liked the drink selection.

It's a nice, sleek interior and there is plenty of seating. Highly recommend.
