So good. Eat here. Or don't, and leave some space for me to sit lol.

Typically I'll read or watch an episode while I eat, but I can't do that to the braised beef noodle from Yaso Tangbao. I respect it too much. The noodles and broth alone are amazing. As for the beef, it's like they served me every cut I typically have to brawl my family for at dinner. 

Also, the soup dumplings are great, just prep for the 20 minute wait.
