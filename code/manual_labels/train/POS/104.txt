Stopped in for lunch yesterday...here are my thoughts:

Buffet is very elaborate and nicely presented. Definitely worth the money although a few of the items weren't super authentic (daal and pakoras).

Ambiance is nice enough. The skeleton at the bar was a nice (if random) addition to the Indian decor (maybe the owner is big on Halloween?). There was no wait on a Monday afternoon.

Service is friendly and fast. 

If in the area again we might return.
