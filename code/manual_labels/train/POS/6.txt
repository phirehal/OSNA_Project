Overpriced Shanghainese food at its best. 

Crab pork xiao long baos
Flushing - $6.95 for 6-8
Yaso - $6.75 for 4

Braised beef soup noodles
Flushing - $5.95
Yaso - $11.50

Bottom line... It's pricey but the food is decent. The soup dumplings are freshly made and they do taste good. 

Not a bad place to eat given the limited options in the area.
