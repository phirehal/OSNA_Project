The service is excellent but quite serious. There was only one waiter who smiled. I had the India House Meal and it was delicious overall. The dahl was a bit bland, not great texture, no perfume but the grilled tandori chicken, lamb kabobs and fish (mahi) were awesome! The servings are generous. The meal for one was more than enough for two. I would order the two person one for four, really! And I like to eat, trust me. Wasn't the best nan I've ever had but bad nan is impossible right?
The rice pudding was also delicious. Nice atmosphere too.
