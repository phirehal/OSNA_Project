YES, we luv Joe's!!!

As one of the most low-key but delicious meals in NYC, gotta say we love Joe's because:

* GET - Xiao Long Bao = Joe's specialty!  We got crab & pork and just-pork varieties, multiplied few times over...
* GET - Stir-fried Green Beans = Yep in all their garlicky glory~
* GET - Scallion Pancake = my Asian cohorts specifically determined this was one of the best they've ever had~
* GET - Stir-fried Pork Rice Cakes = yeeees, so chewy and tasty
* GET - Pork Flaky Pepper Bun = lmao, don't know what this is actually called but it was good

* YES - Loud, boisterous "dinner" ambiance even at 9:45pm!
* YES - We got lucky!!   Line was out the door with several parties ahead of us: we waited 3 minutes only (maybe worked my front-door charm?  LOL!)
* YES - Since we were small party of 4, we ended up sharing table with this adorable Trinidadian family...ended up making new friends!   Ahhh New York...
* YES - Good for large parties, although that may equate to longer wait

* FYI - Yes, accepts credit cards
* FYI - Yes, Chinese-joint so waiters are rushed, quick, but not necessarily polite
* FYI - No reservations
