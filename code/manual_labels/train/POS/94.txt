Definitely one of the best szechuan food in Midtown. I wanted to give it at least 4 stars but honestly the wait is getting worse and worse now. This was one of the first Chinese restaurant I've been to ever since I moved to the area about 5 years ago. Back then it wasn't as popular as it is now so we didn't have to spend as much time waiting. This most recent time despite having a reservation for 5 people it took about 30 minute of waiting for us to be finally able to sit at a table.

Restaurant itself isn't very big and the restroom are located downstairs instead of on same level. I think the noise level have also gotten louder over the years I've been here but it hasn't gotten too bad where its hard to have a conversation.

That being said.. the food is fantastic as always whenever I do get to come here. My recommendations would definitely be their appetizer line ups as well as the items under Szechuan specials. Its a Szechuan restaurant there's really no point not getting spicy szechaun food while you're here.

Prices were bit high in terms of szechuan food but I suppose its about average with the fact its in midtown. But food wise definitely can't go wrong as I've tried most of their items under appetizers and small plates and really its quite delicious and authentic.

I would steer away during their busy times and probably only come for dinner either before 6 or after 8.. But if you don't mind waiting its definitely quite authentic and excellent dining experience.
