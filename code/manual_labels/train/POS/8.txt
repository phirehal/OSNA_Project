Soup dumplings in Downtown Brooklyn. Close to where I live! They're quite flavorful and have appropriately thin skins. They're more expensive than in the Chinatowns, but that's what you get for being in this neighborhood.

The khao fu--gluten with mushrooms, peanuts, etc., was really good and unobtainable in any place around here. We've also had the braised beef noodle soup--great flavor and beef, but the noodles are a little character-less. 

I've been waiting for a REAL Chinese  (of any region) restaurant to show up in this area, and my patience has been rewarded.

You order at the counter and sit at the bench/table things they've got going on. A perfunctory selection of cold drinks and I haven't even noticed if there's tea.
