Pros: accessible to the western palate, friendly and attentive owner, good service 
Cons: small seating space, no bar, not the mosh authentic
Must Have: tandoori wings

I got the tandoori wings and chicken biryanj. The wings were gooey delicious and the biryanj was tasty. However,I feel like they restaurant is making a concession to their Lincoln Park neighbors by toning down the spice and populating the menu with fusion dishes. My fiancé is Indian and has burned off my taste buds with lava hot spice curries, so I found the food too mild for my tastes.

The space is two stories and seemed too small for a restaurant.  There is not a hallway or foyer to separate the front door from the tables, so it got a bit drafty in winter. They do not have a liquor license, but it is BYOB.
