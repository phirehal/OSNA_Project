Have been so excited for the opening of Yaso Tangbao and apparently I am not the only one - went on a Monday around 12:30 pm and most tables were full. They specialize in shanghainese street food.

This review is for takeout only. My order only took about 5-7 minutes, so they are quick, even with lots of other people waiting. I tried the mapo doufu (tofu) over rice. It consists of ground pork mixed with soft pieces of tofu in a sauce, served over rice and topped with two fried eggs (yolks were hard, sadly). It was tasty and a generous portion.

I also tried one of their "bites" - the shaoxing wine chicken or "drunken chicken." I've never had this dish before so maybe I just need to acquire a taste for it but I felt it was mainly fat and bone, making it hard to eat and slightly unappealing. I will absolutely be back for dinner so that I can dine in and try their soup dumplings (dine in only). They have specials going all through october (my lunch was 10% off) so I definitely recommend heading over and giving them a try!
