The food at this place opens the tanDOOR to another dimension of eating.

Indian cuisine isn't my #1 choice when it comes to regional delicacies--Greek, Mexican, Sushi, and Chinese are the frontrunners--but Tandoor Char House is making a strong case for inclusion on that short list.  I met a friend here on a recommendation, and I'm glad I did.

The beef nehari was killer.  Essentially beef stew, it had nice large chunks of tender sirloin and was garnished with freshly sliced jalapenos.  Very good.  Accompanying that was an order of the mutter paneer tikka masala, which was pieces of paneer cheese in a hearty tomato sauce.  Feeling ravenous, I polished off a sizable portion of both with room to spare.

I couldn't resist the lure of sweet temptation, so for dessert I opted for kheer (rice pudding with almonds and saffron) and a gulab jamun to go, which are basically doughnut holes soaked in syrup.  They were okay, not nearly as good as the entrees (which came with rice and a side salad).  The complimentary chutneys were varied and flavorful - the spicy 'achar' (giardiniera), the refreshing 'raita' (yogurt cucumber sauce), the fiery cilantro, and the tangy sweet tamarind.  I'll be sure to order naan on my next trip.

My only regret is not having taken any pictures, but I didn't want to disturb the low-light atmo with obnoxious Instagramming, etc, so I restrained myself.  The dining area was small yet intimate and lightly decorated.  Service was great and the prices were fair.

Breads = 5
Circuses = 4

Highly recommended.
