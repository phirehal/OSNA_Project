I've had Joe's Shanghai bookmarked for quite some time and was looking forward to some delicious xiao long bao.  I feared that we would have to wait but to our surprise we were seated right away.  The tables are very close to each other and some parties share a table with others as well.  

We ordered 2 orders of xiao long bao (8 for $8 and change) and an order of Shanghai chow mein (however they called it something else, like stir fried flat noodle or something).  The xiao long baos were big and full of broth and served piping hot.  So much juice that I even squirted some on the table as I bit into it, however, the dumplings were bland and even the vinegar tasted diluted and the ginger wasn't fragrant at all.  The xiao long bao held up pretty well with only one served punctured.  The Shanghai chow mein was standard, plentiful and had a little more flavor.

Service was solid.  It's cash only and they automatically add gratuity on the bill.  If I recall correctly our bill was about $28.  Joe's Shanghai can't compare to my beloved Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, and I've even enjoyed xiao long bao more in San Francisco.  2.5ish rounded up.
