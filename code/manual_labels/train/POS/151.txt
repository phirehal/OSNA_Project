Local neighborhood gem!

I came here for Taco Tuesday the first time this week. Pretty sweet deal. I wasn't expecting the tacos to be as good as they were-very surprising for vegetarian. They only have two options and the other being beef.

The margaritas are delicious, and more importantly be sure to say hi to Edgar.

Best server EVER.
