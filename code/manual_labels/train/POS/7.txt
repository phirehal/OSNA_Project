Vibe: cozy
Decor/seating: mostly picnic style bench seating

Have been looking for good soup dumplings around the neighborhood after moving here a few months back, and was pleasantly surprised by this place! Loved the soup dumplings.

Also ordered the braised beef noodles, which were decent but not as great as the dumplings.

Lived in Asia for a while and now I've found my new favorite spot in the neighborhood! Reminds me of home.
