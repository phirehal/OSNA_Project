Excellent Chinese food for very reasonable prices. We had the pork soup dumplings, which were delectable! The broth was just so rich and flavorful. We also had a few other dishes that were also good. I can't recall the names of the other dishes....but all tasty! The service was friendly and efficient as well. I'll be back!
