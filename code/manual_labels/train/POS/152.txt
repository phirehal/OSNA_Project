Great service on a Wednesday night.  We arrived just minutes before happy hour ended and two different servers encouraged us to get our orders in quickly to get the discount.  

Food - fish tacos were good, but the mango salsa is VERY spicy.  Was hoping they'd be served with beans & rice, but for $8 I shouldn't have expected it.  Shared the quesadilla which had veggies & beans in it, huge plus.
