Delicious Indian food, classy and beautiful decor and atmosphere, friendly and professional waiters and staff. India house is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. 

The menu had a great selection of various curries and breads. As soon as we were seated, the waiter always brings out a sizzling plate of tandoori chicken. So impressive and cooked to sweet and tender perfection.

Everything I have tried on the menu has been amazing. Some of my favorite dishes are:

Chicken makhani (butter chicken): A creamy and tangy curry with soft chicken. 

Saag paneer (spinach and homemade cheese cubes): A personal favorite, I love the creamy spinach curry and chewy blocks of paneer.

Lamb vindaloo: A heavier and savory flavor with rich curry and spices.

Mango lassi: refreshing and tropical mango smoothie with cool sweet flavor.

Kheer rice pudding: I loved this dessert as a slight sweet and refreshing finale to the Indian meal.

Gulab Jamun fried balls of milk pastry soaked in sweet hot saffron syrup. So yum.

My favorite time to visit has been for the weekday lunch buffet. It is a great value to try many different curries and desserts. I also had enjoyed coming during dinner time with a group of 10. We were able to order many different dishes family style, which was also a fun and intimate experience.

Overall, delicious food, great service, classy atmosphere. I can't wait to come again in the future to enjoy another taste of India House.
