the chef is the executive chef from Joe Shanghai.
no complains for the soup dumplings. (4 is a number that's very hard to order, frankly speaking)  

rice sticks, traditional shanghai snacks, it's interesting to try, but 4 is too much since the dish is  mono, it starts to get boring after the 2nd one. 

skip the garlic cucumber, cucumber is not marinated long enough.

In general the ingredients quality is better than most of the Chinese places. I'd want to go back to try something else.
