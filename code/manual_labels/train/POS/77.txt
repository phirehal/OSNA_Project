Ordered from here today via DoorDash. I'm impressed by the quality! Most Chinese takeout ends up being extremely greasy and while good during the process of eating, not so good after a few hours. 

I got the steamed pork buns and the green beans. The pork buns were very fresh: the dough was fluffy and soft and the meat inside was savory and not overbearing. This is an appetizer so in total there were 4 medium-sized buns-definitely enough to get you to 50% full. The green beans were not extraordinary but they were good. I liked that they came with some pickled radishes, which added an extra layer of flavor. 

Definitely want to try some other stuff on the menu next time! Or maybe go in person for some dim sum, since that's what they seem to be known for.
