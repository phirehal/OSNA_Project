
Having zero experience with GOOD soup dumplings in CT, I was super excited to find out about Joe's.

Victims:
- Xiao Long Bao or "Little Dumplings in the Basket" (Pork version)
- Scallion pancake (omg, try this, you won't regret it!)
- Vegetable with bean curd (so'kay)

Their hours everyday, are 11am-11pm. Arriving exactly at 1130am, I was not surprised to find out that there was a 30 minute wait. Bordering on being "hangry", it was well worth the wait. Seating is communal style -- there are about a dozen large circular tables of 10. It's fun dining with complete strangers! Our dining companions were mostly from New England, but we had a couple straight from France! Dumplings are fresh and made to order. They arrived at our table in piping hot bamboo steamers. Each plump dumpling contains a little pork meatball surrounded by a delightful meaty broth.

To prevent burning one's mouth and to savor the dumpling, the BEST method of consumption is to bite off a little piece of the doughy wrapper, drip the broth to a spoon or suck the broth with a "slurp", and then down the hatch! It was really funny watching newbies and other diners fail so hard.

Knowing we were going to spend the rest of the day in the City, we didn't want to overeat. Otherwise, I would have easily tried the spicy szechuan-style sliced beef, crispy jumbo prawns w/ lime sauce, or braised duck. 

If this is your first time in Chinatown, don't forget to try these guys out!
