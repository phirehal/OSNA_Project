I have been wanting to try Joe's Shanghai for years now. Finally, I was able to make it down to Chinatown to try the soup dumplings.

We got to the restaurant and the people at the "front" asked us if we wanted to wait (about 20 minutes) or sit at a shared table. We didn't want to wait so we sat at a 6 person table and ordered quickly.  I do have to say that it was a bit awkward at first but we got talking with our neighbors.

We got the scallion pancake as an appetizer and the pork only dumpling and the pork and shrimp dumpling. The scallion pancake was crispy and well cooked bit I just wished it was a bit warmer.
Both dumpling orders (most of the dumplings with the exception of a few that were punctured) were filled with delicious broth. The dumplings itself are larger than the kind I have had at Din Tai Fung and definitely more soup (in those that were intact). The soup was fattier also. 

I was disappointed that some dumplings were broken and the soup had leaked out.  

Definitely worth making your way down to Chinatown to try the soup dumplings!
