This place was really good! I thought the service could have been improved a bit, but the food itself was stellar.

I came here with a friend and tried the pork xiao long bao, the basil chicken (aka the three cup chicken? not sure if that's a legitimate Chinese to English translation), and the pan fried pork buns. The xiao long bao were SO good and were fatty and hot. Every time I ate a xiao long bao I got this kind of warm feeling in my belly which was great! The pan fried pork buns were super juicy as well, and the basil chicken was perfectly seasoned/marinated. This place was pretty full, but at the same time, it wasn't too busy or packed with tourists, which I really liked. 

I thought the service would have been better. Our waitress didn't seem super happy to be serving us, and at one point, I think she told us that we were eating slowly (but we weren't positive this is what she said; she said this quickly in Mandarin). In any case, the food was much much better than the actual service.

I would definitely recommend coming here over the super famous places that have long waits, if you're ever in the mood for Shanghainese!
