I had the soup dumplings a couple weeks ago and then today I tried the braised pork meatballs over rice with eggs. The soup dumplings were very good, although I do feel like an order is pretty expensive compared to other places I've been in Flushing and Manhattan. The meatballs over rice with eggs were very good, and I splurged and got some of the chili oil (which I don't actually think should be an upcharge item) and it was delicious, although it brought my lunch cost to $14. The pork meatballs were perfectly cooked and flavorful. The eggs were a little overdone, but nothing to freak out about. Overall, I will visit again, as everything on the menu looks amazing, but this spot is too expensive for more than once a week. Check it out, it has great food and is very approachable for anyone not familiar with Chinese food (not me, but most of my coworkers).
