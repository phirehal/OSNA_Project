Great place for Shanghai food lovers! This place has the most authentic Shanghai food! . The price is reasonable And their service is pretty good. And I love this place, it's so clean and the atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable! I'll definitely come back with my bae for their TANGBAO and Shaoxing chicken!
