I had an excellent experience here and I'll definitely be returning.  There is a good selection of vegetarian entrees. I had the chana masala, which I requested medium, and that's exactly what I got - it was hot, but not overwhelmingly spicy.

I was waited on primarily by Jake, who was superb. Outstandingly polite and friendly. All the staff were warm and pleasant. Keep up the good work!!
