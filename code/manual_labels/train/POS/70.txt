Soup dumplings! Soup dumplings! Soup dumplings! Soup dumplings! Soup dumplings!  I've not really eaten anything else here but soup dumplings so all I can really say is MMMMMM soup dumplings!  Careful, they are HOT and will burn the ever living C$#P out of your mouth if you're not careful. But if you take your time you will be rewarded by a mouth full of flavorful broth and a nugget of just right pork dumpling.  

The place could use a renovation but perhaps it's shabby interior is part of the charm?  The China Town location is way better, cheaper and somehow not as ramshackle as the mid town location.  Don't go here for the ambiance that's for sure.  It's the food you came for, enjoy it!.
