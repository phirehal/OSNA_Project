It's the best shanghai/chinese food I ever had in NYC. Really traditional Chinese good, I will recommend to anyone who wants to taste the real Shanghai cusine. Tangbao is a must try, and wine chicken tastes really good. Decorations are modern, it's one of the best soup dumpling restaruant I have ever visited. Although the price is a little bit higher than other chinese restaurant around, but it's still resonable, and you will defiantly get better service and food quality than normal Chinese restaruant for this price. Highly recommended!
