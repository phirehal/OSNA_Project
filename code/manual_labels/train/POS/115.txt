So the food was good, we had the lobster ravioli and the lamb chops. The bread for the table had a crust that was too hard but okay I guess. The main issue I had with this place was how noisy it was. Brought a date here and could barely hear each other talk. Check online for groupons, we found one for Friday night making the price very reasonable.
