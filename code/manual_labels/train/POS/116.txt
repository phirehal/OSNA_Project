Peter the best server we had in Chicago!!
And to go with that the most amazing Italian food I have ever had. (Sorry briganti)
This place has taken the 1st place, too bad I live in Los Angeles. 
This place has a beautiful inside very romantic and cozy.
The food OMG!!!! THE FOOD!!!!
IF you are looking for mouthwatering Italian food, this is the place to go!!
My wife was very happy to spend her birthday here and we made it a priority to return here prior to returning to Los Angeles. 
Thank you for your orgasmic food and friendly service.
