Great place to have dinner with my best friend. I have been in New York for 6 years and I came from Shanghai. I feel Yaso Tangbao is the closest taste to my hometown. We ordered Yaso Pork Soup Dumplings, Pork And Bok Choy Wonton, Spicy Diced Pork Noodle , Chicken Curry Noodle Soup, Braised Pork Meatballs Over Rice With Eggs, Wine Chicken, Garlic Cucumber Salad and Spicy Cabbage Salad. They all taste so local and I love the environment very much. Strongly recommend!!!
