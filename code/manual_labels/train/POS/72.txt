Going to join in on the hype and say that the crab soup dumplings here are the best I've had in the states. The pungent flavor of crab intestines really comes through, whereas I've found at other places that it's hard to distinguish the crab from the pork soup dumplings. In my experience, this location does a much more consistent job of providing fresh batches of dumplings versus the Midtown location. If you come at an off-peak time, the wait is very reasonable. We arrived around 5pm on a weekday, pre-dinner rush, and waited less than 10 minutes. Focus on the soup dumplings and order other dishes as sides, since everything else is pretty run-of-the-mill.
