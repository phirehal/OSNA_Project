I find myself at Joe's Shanghai once a month to get my fix of those fatty, gelatinous, little pockets of heaven and there was nothing different about yesterday...except for Chinese New Year. Dragons all over Chinatown stopped at every business to wish them good luck for the new year and of course, they stopped in to JS to do the same. Most of the time you didn't even know they were there because the drums were kept outside, so the dragons would dance quietly at the front of the restaurant and every now and then the owners would applaud the performance.

Anyway...I went for the pork soup dumplings (the crab ones would literally kill me, $6-7) and the Shanghai fried rice ($5.95) and in my opinion was the perfect amount of food for two people. You always see people ordering 3 things: the dumplings, a main, and a side, and they only ever finish two. When we did feel hungry after the soup dumplings and rice, we just ordered another round of dumplings. The bill came out to $25 and some change *which includes tip in the bill so don't pay anything extra!*  and we left happy, full-bellied customers.
