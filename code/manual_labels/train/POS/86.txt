We came here for dinner, and I must say, it was a very nice and pleasant experience. I was expecting it to be noisy inside the restaurant due to the very active street outside, but it was actually quite the opposite. It's nice to be able to enjoy a meal in such a way. Anyway, on to the food!

We ordered the pork XLB (xiao long bao), beef pan fried noodles, and fish filet with pepper. The XLB were delicious, the broth was rich and flavorful. The beef pan fried noodles were good as well, however, it was too saucy for our preference. We like the noodles to have some crunch to it but the noodles were drenched in sauce. The bf felt that the mushroom flavor in the noodles was too overpowering. And finally, the fish filet was good in flavor. It actually came in several small filets, I had imagined it to be one large fish filet but that didn't bother us. 

Definitely will come back for more XLB!
