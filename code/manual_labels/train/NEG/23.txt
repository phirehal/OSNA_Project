This place looks pretty promising and a great additional to the area that has some semi-legit Chinese/Shanghainese food. The price tag is a bit high and the quality is average to good but considering there's not many asian food selections, the high price is to be expected ($8.5 for 6 regular soup dumplings). Since it's still in its soft-opening phase, perhaps the menu will change slightly in time. They are also running a 10% off discount during this time. So on my first trip, I tried the chicken noodles with vegetables. It was okay as far as taste; used MSG, but passable to get some comforting Chinese food for lunch. In looking through the menu, I am looking forward to trying out more of the small plates.
