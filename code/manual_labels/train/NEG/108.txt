After reading the reviews for this place I expected a lot better. While the restaurant was nice and the service was good, I hate to say the food was a little overrated. While I've been to many restaurants, I can honestly say I've had better.

The Aloo Tikki Chaat was not bad, but I would not recommend the Paneer Tikka Masala or the Chicken Biryani.
