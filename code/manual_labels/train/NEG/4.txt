Soup dumplings have come to Downtown Brooklyn, and seeing as how I live a very short walk away, this is dangerous to my health. Because soup dumplings combine two of my favorite things in the world (soup and dumplings).

As far as I can tell, Yaso Tangbao is a godsend. The place is clean and comfortable, as well as one of few places in this part of the 'hood that I actually don't mind sitting and eating. The xiao long bao (soup dumplings to you whiteys*) are on point, the mapo doufu (tofu to you whiteys) is delicious, if a bit salty, and the counter service is pretty friendly.

I have a few minor complaints, but they are nothing that can't be fixed or overlooked in the face of delicious soup dumplings:

1. The soup spoons provided are disposable, flimsy things. If we're eating here, why not provide some real spoons, and reduce some of the waste?**

2. The soup spoons are also too small. They can't properly hold an entire dumpling, which led to my dominant female overlord (wife to you whiteys) clumsily losing some deliciousness onto the nice wooden tables. This is unforgivable, and I have since begun divorce proceedings. 

3. The eggs on top of the mapo doufu were seriously overcooked. Keep the eggs runny, people. A runny egg makes everything better.

4. There's no alcohol. There should always be alcohol. This includes the bar mitzvah I was forced to attend over the weekend. I don't care if they are still children in the eyes of the "law," Judaism says that kid is a man now. At least let me drink to that, even if he isn't into whiskey just yet.
