Shanghai House is medicore at best.
Wobbly tables and chairs. Service is always reminding you that you need to wait. (For example, if you order pan friend buns, they will remind you multiple times that it takes 10-15 minutes. Alright already, we know!) These buns were just okay. Sort of bland.
Nothing was amazing and as normal chinese food goes, everything was a oily. Soup dumplings were alright.
