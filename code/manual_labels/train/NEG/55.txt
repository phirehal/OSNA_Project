Another total flop at Joe's yesterday. The time before last we complained that the dumplings were breaking too easily and it just happened again! Yesterday, the dumplings were bigger than usual and I guess stickier because out of the 24 that we had, 21 broke. We're not new to this and have been coming here for years so what gives? It looks like they've been putting flour on the lettuce leaves and then steaming them, which is making the flour act as glue. Good luck explaining that, though, so I hope you like soup dumplings without the soup. 

The pork fried rice is good, though.
