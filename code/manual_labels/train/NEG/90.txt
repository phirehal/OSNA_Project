Honestly, not bad!

From Yelp ratings, I expected less.  Sure, no one was really friendly in service, but:

* DRK - Hot tea = b/c we're old.  J/K, tea goes well with greasy Chinese food
* GET - Spicy Beef Noodle = yummy
* GET - Madam Songs Braised Noodle = so hella salty and hella spicy...I thought it was more like a dish (to be eaten with rice, to offset saltiness) but my friend loved her dish
* GET - Shredded Pork & Szechuan Pickle Noodles = it was really odd they added shredded carrots (not usually in this dish) but it was still good, noodles were fresh and it hit the spot
* APP - Jellyfish and Spicy Broccoli = both small portions and tasty!
* YES - Saw LOTS of non-Chinese eating here, I always like seeing that

* FYI - Service was A-OK, but food was good, place was clean so we didn't care much
* FYI - Good for large or small groups
* FYI - No wait on a weeknight, not crowded
* FYI - Accepts credit cards
