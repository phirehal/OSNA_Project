Might as well be inedible. The service included an inefficient hostess, a throw the menu on the table waiter and a money hungry waiter who yelled " time to collect the money" and then not give us change. I couldn't have mind the change if he didn't make such a remark so loudly. In addition the place was super loud so I can't even hear myself. 
For starters we got the shredded pork and pickled cabbage soup. There were not cabbage in the soup -_-  and too much gross tasting pork. Tasted like pork and some weird pickle boiled in msg water. 
Now for the star of the show, their most prized dish, soup dumplings... We got both varieties the pork soup dumplings and the crab meat soup dumpling. First of all the wrapping of the soup dumplings were tough, sticky and way to thick but even so they manage to have almost all of they leaking. The pork soup dumplings were almost flavorless with the remainder of the filling. And the crab meat soup dumpling tasted and smelled like rotten seafood being masked with pork... It stunned so bad I gagged and thought I was going to throw up. So thank god for the oranges they provide at the end of the meal since I couldnt get rid of the taste regardless of how much tea I've gulped down afterwards.
