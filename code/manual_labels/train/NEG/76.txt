I'm a fan of Shanghai food and when I heard of this relatively new place from my colleague , I had to come to try it out. 

With all new restaurants, it's clean looking. The service is very good as well.

The kau fu was one of the best I had in Chinatowns shanghainese restaurants. However, the soup dumplings are a bit lacking. The taste is a bit bland and lacking in flavor. The fried pork buns are just ok. 

All would have been well if  both my friend and I had didn't have diarrhea that night. 

Skip this place and go somewhere else.
