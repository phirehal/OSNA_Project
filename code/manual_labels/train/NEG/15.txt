Went for in for soup dumplings. They were ok, but unfortunately $5 only gets you 4 pork dumplings (seriously guys, you are not located in Manhattan) and the meat quality in the ground pork is not that great 2 of my 4 dumplings had hard chewy parts in them. Furthermore the soup spoon I got was too small to hold the dumpling and all the juicy goodness went splashing over the sides once I bit into my dumpling.
If you want soup dumplings I recommend you go to Joe's Shanghai dumplings in Chinatown (Manhattan).
