I hope you're not too shy because it's more than likely you'll sit with strangers since it's family style seating. In my party of five, we managed to snag seats, but with two other parties already sitting there. I noticed off the bat they each ordered soup dumplings from the bamboo steamers on table, which was a good sign because these puppies were exactly the reason why we came here.

The dumplings were perfect. Tender and supple, and the soup wasn't too hot making it impossible to eat. Eight dumplings per order and trust me, they went by fast. The price was decent as well (besides my snow pea leaves which ran for a whopping $16... Way more than the dumplings).

The service was your typical Chinatown service... Quick and succinct. Also typical of NYC, they don't really like to split the checks with big parties, despite us only wanting to split it three ways. When we asked to split ours, the server quickly interrupted my friend, telling her to simply add the totals and figure it out among ourselves. Rude much? Or is it just New York?

Overall, I'd come again. With CASH. They don't take card.
