Had dinner here on a beautiful spring evening, had the Mao Po Tofu which I gather was one of the specialties of the house. It was a searingly hot version loaded with more peppercorns than minced pork, it was a tad oily but thats a lovely chili oil so no complaints. Im not the biggest tofu fan and wouldve preferred it a bit firmer, my dinner companion said it reminded her of undercooked eggs lol but shes not a tofu fan. She enjoyed her spicy chicken dish. Both came with a small bowl of white rice. An ice cold Tsintao soothed the burn and I had that numb tingly feeling on my tongue for awhile afterwards. 
     The place itself is kinda small but we got a table fast,however they placed another couple right on top of us so it was like we were sharing a table ruining any intimate conversations. Service was fast (perhaps too fast) and efficient if not exactly warm.
