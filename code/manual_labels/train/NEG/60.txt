I'm still searching for a decent soup dumpling restaurant in NYC. For me, this restaurant falls short on many levels. Immediately, upon entering, you'll be hit with a funky smell. The restaurant probably needs new carpet. Give it a few minutes and you'll get used to the smell. On to the food. All of our dishes were glistening in oil. I've come to expect this type of preparation at most chinese restaurants, but it was a little too much here. After waiting 30+ mins to get seated, you're ready to feast, so you get past the smell and oiliness quickly. Your stomach will be full after a meal here, but the quality and atmosphere could be improved. Also, don't forget this is a cash only restaurant!
