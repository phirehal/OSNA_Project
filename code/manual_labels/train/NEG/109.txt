Terrible service. I ordered online and waited over 2 hours to get the food. I called the restaurant multiple times and whoever answered the call had me on hold for few minutes only to cut the line. The rare times this person (always the same one) chose to speak, it was usually one line "order is on the way only 10 minutes". The food delivery guy said he only received the items "10 minutes" ago when he showed up. 

So not worth waiting 2 hours, food was oily, i drenched 3 tissues to get it all out, still couldn't eat it. Never again to this "10 minutes" food place. If only i can trade the one star on yelp i'm obligated to give for all the minutes i had to spend dealing with this place.
