My friend sent me here she was raving about it I value her opinion so I turned up for lunch. I had 4 dumplings - and a small soup. Both dishes were okay nothing to rave about and expensive for what I got. My main problem was with the staff: snooty- I asked how big the various dishes were and what they were and neither of the two women I asked were helpful - it's as if I should know even though this restaurant has only been open for a few weeks - I felt like I was bothering them. I work on Willoughby and my co workers were excited when I came into the office with the bag but they were all unimpressed by what I revealed. Shame because Downtown Brooklyn's lunch choices are so boring this place could have been the light I was looking for. I was put off by the people behind the counter making the dumplings were not wearing gloves. I won't be back.
