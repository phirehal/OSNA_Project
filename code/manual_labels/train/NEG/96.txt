The food here was really delicious and had just the right level of spiciness, enough where you can call it Sichuan-style, but not to the point where the spice actually masks the food. 

Some of the highlights were the fish stew, pork belly with leeks, and the cumin lamb, which was unique in the way it was coated and deep-fried. Most Sichuan places don't prepare it this way (they wok-fry it without any coating), but this still seemed to work very well.

The service was lightning fast. Didn't have to wait for our food at all.

Most of the food was a bit on the oily side, but perhaps that's expected.
