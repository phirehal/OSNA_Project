Good was ok.
I went for on reservation party of 9 for Sunday Buffett brunch. With a reservation we were sat in a corner table way in the back next to the kitchen where the servers constantly walked through back and forth. We basically hate in the kitchen. In the end they added an 18% gratuity... For a party of 9 Buffett, all the servers did was pour us water... 
I will not go there again and won't recommend anyone to go.
You can find just as good Indian food with better service and better table.
