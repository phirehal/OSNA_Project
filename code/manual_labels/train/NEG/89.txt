Always my go-to to hearty Chinese/Szechuan food when I'm at work since it's just a few blocks away. They are almost always packed, so be prepared to go early, or wait for a little bit. They do have a decently sized waiting area right before you enter into the dining room :).

I think this is a very authentic place to get your szechuan staples - my favorites are double cooked pork, mapo tofu, and their fish fillet in chili oil. All of them are DELICIOUS. I've had the misfortune of ordering double cooked pork at other places to find that it's just regular americanized pieces of pork (kind of like the ones you would get in thai food if you add pork to it) that don't look taste like the fatty chinese bacon pieces it's supposed to be.

Tip: Their lunch specials are such a steal!!! Most of them average at $7.95; sometimes I order two different ones so I can have some cheap food for dinner too ;).
