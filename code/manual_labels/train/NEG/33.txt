There's nothing wrong with the food, but this is not, as another reviewer said, comparable with Chinatown establishments in affordability (-1 star). The portions are small, for one thing, and there's no table service.

The place looks much cleaner than the other Chinese restaurant there, but I didn't see a city health grade on the storefront. It's very well furnished; along with the location, the prices correlate.
