I was sadly quite disappointed with Joe's Shanghai.  After trying Nan Xiang a couple of weeks ago, someone whose food opinion I highly respect recommended this place, so I was very excited to try it, especially being that Flushing is a hike and a half away for me.

We went to Joe's on a Tuesday night.  The place was packed.  We were seated immediately at a communal table.  The service was a little spotty.  Although we personally had a pretty good experience, the people across from us would beg to differ.  Their server accidentally threw away their to-go food and then took ~10 minutes to admit it, while they were trying to leave. Awkward to watch - one of the drawbacks of the communal table situation. Part of the reason that it's annoying is that they automatically add gratuity onto the bill here.  

We ordered the crab & pork soup dumplings, the Shanghai noodles, and a side of bok choy.  

The dumplings came out first.  Even though all the flavors were there, EVERY SINGLE DUMPLING broke.  Not the best craftsmanship and made it very difficult to eat them.  

Next were the Shanghai noodles.  These were pretty standard and this was a large portion, so we were overall happy with the dish.  

Lastly, the bok choy came out.  While I love bok choy, it prompted both me and my dining partner to independently ask if bok choy was in season.  While there was nothing specifically wrong with the dish, it wasn't fantastic either.  

All in all, for $36, this was a large amount of food, but it certainly did not live up to the hype for me.
