The dumplings were good. I tried the crab ones. There was an abundance of soup in them compared to other places I've eaten at! We also got some sort of stir fried noodle dish that was pretty tasty, as well. 

However, I felt uneasy at this place due to the aesthetics and scent it was giving off. We were seated next to their recycle containers and for the duration of my meal, I couldn't really enjoy my food because there was a strong sour odor I couldn't ignore coming from them. 

The employees also kept coming in & out of this closet behind them and had to remove the recycle bins back and forth to open the door to get into this closet. At one point, one moved the bin too far out and it brushed up on my arm and it really grossed me out!

Sorry I can't overlook this one and regardless how good the dumplings were, I can't shake this one off.
